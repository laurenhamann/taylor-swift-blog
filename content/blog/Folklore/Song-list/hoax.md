<p className="verse-one">
My only one <br />
My smoking gun <br />
My eclipsed sun <br />
This has broken me down <br />
My twisted knife <br />
My sleepless night <br />
My win-less fight <br />
This has frozen my ground <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Stood on the cliffside <br />
Screaming, "Give me a reason" <br />
Your faithless love's the only hoax <br />
I believe in <br />
Don't want no other shade of blue <br />
But you <br />
No other sadness in the world would do <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
My best laid plan <br />
Your sleight of hand <br />
My barren land <br />
I am ash from your fire <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Stood on the cliffside <br />
Screaming "Give me a reason" <br />
Your faithless love's the only hoax <br />
I believe in <br />
Don't want no other shade of blue <br />
But you <br />
No other sadness in the world would do <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You know I left a part of me back in New York <br />
You knew the hero died, so what's the movie for? <br />
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars <br />
From when they pulled me apart <br />
You knew the password, so I let you in the door <br />
You knew you won, so what's the point of keeping score? <br />
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars <br />
From when they pulled me apart <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
But what you did was just as dark <br />
Darling, this was just as hard <br />
As when they pulled me apart <br />
My only one <br />
My kingdom come undone <br />
My broken drum <br />
You have beaten my heart <br />
Don't want no other shade of blue <br />
But you <br />
No other sadness in the world would do <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote cite="https://www.vulture.com/2020/07/taylor-swift-folklore-aaron-dessner-breaks-down-every-song.html">
This is a big departure. I think she said to me, “Don’t try to give it any other space other than what feels natural to you.” If you leave me in a room with a piano, I might play something like this. I take a lot of comfort in this. I think I imagined her playing this and singing it. After writing all these songs, this one felt the most emotional and, in a way, the rawest. It is one of my favorites. There’s sadness, but it’s a kind of hopeful sadness. It’s a recognition that you take on the burden of your partners, your loved ones, and their ups and downs. That’s both “peace” and “hoax” to me. That’s part of how I feel about those songs because I think that’s life. There’s a reality, the gravity or an understanding of the human condition. - Aaron Dessner
