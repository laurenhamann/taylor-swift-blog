<p className="verse-one">
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit <br />
Been saying "yes" instead of "no" <br />
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though <br />
I hit the ground running each night <br />
I hit the Sunday matinée <br />
You know the greatest films of all time were never made <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I guess you never know, never know <br />
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed <br />
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow <br />
And it's alright now <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But we were something, don't you think so? <br />
Roaring 20s, tossing pennies in the pool <br />
And if my wishes came true <br />
It would've been you <br />
In my defense, I have none <br />
For never leaving well enough alone <br />
But it would've been fun <br />
If you would've been the one <br />
(Ooh) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I have this dream you're doing cool shit <br />
Having adventures on your own <br />
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home <br />
We never painted by the numbers, baby <br />
But we were making it count <br />
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I guess you never know, never know <br />
And it's another day waking up alone <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But we were something, don't you think so? <br />
Roaring 20s, tossing pennies in the pool <br />
And if my wishes came true <br />
It would've been you <br />
In my defense, I have none <br />
For never leaving well enough alone <br />
But it would've been fun <br />
If you would've been the one <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you <br />
If one thing had been different <br />
Would everything be different today? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We were something, don't you think so? <br />
Rosé flowing with your chosen family <br />
And it would've been sweet <br />
If it could've been me <br />
In my defense, I have none <br />
For digging up the grave another time <br />
But it would've been fun <br />
If you would've been the one <br />
(Ooh) <br />
</p>
