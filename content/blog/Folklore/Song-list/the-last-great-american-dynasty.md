<p className="verse-one">
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train <br />
It was sunny <br />
Her saltbox house on the coast <br />
Took her mind off St. Louis <br />
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money <br />
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?" <br />
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche <br />
There's only so far new money goes <br />
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House" <br />
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud <br />
The doctor had told him to settle down <br />
It must have been her fault his heart gave out <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And they said <br />
"There goes the last great American dynasty" <br />
"Who knows if she never showed up, what could've been" <br />
"There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen" <br />
"She had a marvelous time ruinin' everything" <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set, forever <br />
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city <br />
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names <br />
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet <br />
And losin' on card game bets with Dalí <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And they said <br />
"There goes the last great American dynasty" <br />
"Who knows if she never showed up, what could've been" <br />
"There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen" <br />
"She had a marvelous time ruinin' everything" <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
They say she was seen on occasion <br />
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea <br />
And in a feud with her neighbor <br />
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green <br />
50 years is a long time <br />
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach <br />
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits <br />
And then it was bought by me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Who knows if I never showed up what could've been <br />
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen <br />
I had a marvelous time ruinin' everything <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I had a marvelous time ruinin' everything <br />
A marvelous time ruinin' everything <br />
A marvelous time <br />
I had a marvelous time <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I’m really proud of [the lyric] ‘She had a marvelous time ruining everything’ from ‘the last great american dynasty’ because it’s about what happens when women step out of their cages and run. It can be a real pearl-clutching moment for society when a woman owns her desires and wildness. And I love the idea that the woman in question would be too joyful in her freedom to even care that she’s ruffling feathers, raising eyebrows or becoming the talk of the town. The idea that she decided there were marvelous times to be had, and that was more important. - Taylor Swift
