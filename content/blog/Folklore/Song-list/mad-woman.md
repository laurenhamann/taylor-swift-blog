<p className="verse-one">
What did you think I'd say to that? <br />
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back? <br />
They strike to kill and you know I will <br />
You know I will <br />
What do you sing on your drive home? <br />
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn? <br />
Does she smile? <br />
Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Every time you call me crazy <br />
I get more crazy <br />
What about that? <br />
And when you say I seem angry <br />
I get more angry <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And there's nothin' like a mad woman <br />
What a shame she went mad <br />
No one likes a mad woman <br />
You made her like that <br />
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out <br />
And you find something to wrap your noose around <br />
And there's nothin' like a mad woman <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Now I breathe flames each time I talk <br />
My cannons all firin' at your yacht <br />
They say, "Move on", but you know, I won't <br />
And women like hunting witches, too <br />
Doing your dirtiest work for you <br />
It's obvious that wanting me dead <br />
Has really brought you two together <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Every time you call me crazy <br />
I get more crazy <br />
What about that? <br />
And when you say I seem angry <br />
I get more angry <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And there's nothin' like a mad woman <br />
What a shame she went mad <br />
No one likes a mad woman <br />
You made her like that <br />
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out <br />
And you find something to wrap your noose around <br />
And there's nothin' like a mad woman <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I'm takin' my time <br />
Takin' my time <br />
'Cause you took everything from me <br />
Watchin' you climb <br />
Watchin' you climb <br />
Over people like me <br />
The master of spin <br />
Has a couple side flings <br />
Good wives always know <br />
She should be mad <br />
Should be scathing like me <br />
But
</p> 
<p className="outro">
no one likes a mad woman <br />
What a shame she went mad <br />
You made her like that <br />
</p>
