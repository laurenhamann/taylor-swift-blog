<p className="verse-one">
We gather here, we line up <br />
Weepin' in a sunlit room, and <br />
If I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes too <br />
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe <br />
All the hell you gave me? <br />
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you <br />
'Til my dying day <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace <br />
And you're the hero flying around, saving face <br />
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake? <br />
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed <br />
Look at how my tears ricochet <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean <br />
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring <br />
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you <br />
But what a ghostly scene <br />
You wear the same jewels that I gave you <br />
As you bury me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace <br />
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave <br />
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake? <br />
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed <br />
Look at how my tears ricochet <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I can go anywhere I want <br />
Anywhere I want, just not home <br />
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood <br />
But you would still miss me in your bones <br />
And I still talk to you (when I'm screaming at the sky) <br />
And when you can't sleep at night (you hear my stolen lullabies) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace <br />
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves <br />
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same <br />
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed <br />
You turned into your worst fears <br />
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain <br />
Crossing out the good years <br />
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed <br />
Look at how my tears ricochet <br />
</p>
