<p className="verse-one">
Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind <br />
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind <br />
In the shoes I gave you as a present <br />
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five <br />
And by the way, I'm going out tonight <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Best believe I'm still bejeweled <br />
When I walk in the room <br />
I can still make the whole place shimmer <br />
And when I meet the band <br />
They ask, "Do you have a man?" <br />
I can still say, "I don't remember" <br />
Familiarity breeds contempt <br />
Don't put me in the basement <br />
When I want the penthouse of your heart <br />
Diamonds in my eyes <br />
I polish up real, I polish up real nice <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Nice <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (too good of a girl) <br />
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (huh), have you heard? (Huh) <br />
I can reclaim the land <br />
And I miss you (I miss you) <br />
But I miss sparkling (ah, hey) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Best believe I'm still bejeweled <br />
When I walk in the room <br />
I can still make the whole place shimmer <br />
And when I meet the band <br />
They ask, "Do you have a man?" <br />
I can still say, "I don't remember" <br />
Familiarity breeds contempt <br />
Don't put me in the basement <br />
When I want the penthouse of your heart <br />
Diamonds in my eyes <br />
I polish up real, I polish up real nice <br />
Nice <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Sapphire tears on my face <br />
Sadness became my whole sky <br />
But some guy said my aura's moonstone <br />
Just 'cause he was high <br />
And we're dancin' all night <br />
And you can try to change my mind <br />
But you might have to wait in line <br />
What's a girl gonna do? <br />
A diamond's gotta shine <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Best believe I'm still bejeweled <br />
When I walk in the room <br />
I can still make the whole place shimmer (shimmer) <br />
And when I meet the band <br />
They ask, "Do you have a man?" <br />
I can still say, "I don't remember" <br />
Familiarity breeds contempt <br />
Don't put me in the basement <br />
When I want the penthouse of your heart <br />
Diamonds in my eyes <br />
I polish up real (nice), I polish up real nice <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
And we're dancin' all night <br />
And you can try to change my mind <br />
But you might have to wait in line <br />
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do? <br />
I polish up nice <br />
Best believe I'm still bejeweled <br />
When I walk in the room <br />
I can still make the whole place shimmer <br />
</p>


## Quote from artist
<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t5sBwyL5z8&t=345s">
The song "Bejeweled" is a song that I think is really about finding confidence when you feel that it's been taken away, for whatever reason. You know, you're feeling insecure, you're feeling taken for granted. One of the things we love to do at night is we love to go dancing, we love to put on an outfit that makes us feel good, and we love to feel like we're still bejeweled. And I think that there are tiny inflections of me, hyping myself up to return to pop music after spending these glorious years writing folk songs and being in this metaphorical forest that I've created. Which I've loved so much but there, there was like a bit of pumping myself back up to be like, "You can do it, you're still bejeweled," like, "I'm still bejeweled, question mark?" Um, we'll see, but that's what the song's about.
