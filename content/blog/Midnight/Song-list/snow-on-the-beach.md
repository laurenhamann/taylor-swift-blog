<p className="verse-one">
One night a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird but fucking beautiful
Flying in a dream, stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight feels impossible
But it's coming down, no sound, it's all around
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh, oh oh
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched aurora borealis green
I've never seen someone live from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird but fucking beautiful
Flying in a dream, stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight feels impossible
But it's coming down, no sound, it's all around
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh, oh oh
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I can't speak afraid to jinx it
I don't even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm All For You like Janet
Can this be a real thing? Can it?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Are we falling like snow at the beach?
Weird but fucking beautiful
Flying in a dream, stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight feels impossible
But it's coming down, no sound, it's all around
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Like snow on the beach (snow on the beach)
Like snow on the beach (are we in a dream?)
Like snow on the beach (you want me)
Like snow (like snow)
But it's coming down, no sound, it's all around
</p>
<p className="outro">
Like snow on the beach (it's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down)
Like snow on the beach
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
(Coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
</p>


## Quote from artist
<blockquote>
“Snow On The Beach,” featuring Lana Del Rey, is track 4 on Midnights, and I can not get through that sentence without grinning because I am such a massive fan of Lana Del Rey, more on that later. The song is about falling in love with someone at the same time as they’re falling in love with you, in this sort of in this cataclysmic, faded moment where you realize someone feels exactly the same way that you feel, at the same moment, and you’re kind of looking around going, “Wait, is this real? Is this a dream? Is this for real? Is it really happening? Kinda like it would be if you were to see snow falling on a beach. And Lana Del Rey is, in my opinion, one of the best musical artists ever, the fact that I get to exist at the same time as her is an honor and a privilege, and the fact that she would be so generous as to collaborate with us on this song is something I’m gonna be grateful for life. Absolutely love her and I really hope you love this song as much as I do.
