<p className="verse-one">
"Your ex-friend's sister <br />
Met someone at a club and he kissed her <br />
Turns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago <br />
Some wannabe Z-lister <br />
And all the outfits were terrible <br />
2003 unbearable <br />
Did you see the photos?" <br />
No, I didn't, but thanks, though <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing <br />
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling <br />
No, I didn't see the news <br />
'Cause we were somewhere else <br />
Stumbled down pretend alleyways <br />
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne <br />
I was taken by the view <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Like we were in Paris <br />
Like we were somewhere else <br />
Like we were in Paris, oh <br />
We were somewhere else <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Privacy sign on the door <br />
And on my page and on the whole world <br />
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours <br />
Levitate above all the messes made <br />
Sit quiet by my side in the shade <br />
And not the kind that's thrown <br />
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing <br />
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling <br />
No, I didn't see the news <br />
'Cause we were somewhere else <br />
Stumbled down pretend alleyways <br />
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne <br />
I was taken by the view <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Like we were in Paris, oh <br />
Like we were somewhere else <br />
Like we were in Paris, oh <br />
We were somewhere else <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I wanna brainwash you <br />
Into loving me forever <br />
I wanna transport you <br />
To somewhere the culture's clever <br />
Confess my truth <br />
In swooping, sloping, cursive letters <br />
Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight <br />
In my mind <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling <br />
No, I didn't see the news <br />
'Cause we were somewhere else <br />
In an alleyway, drinking champagne <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause we were in Paris <br />
Yes, we were somewhere else <br />
My love, we were in Paris <br />
Yes, we were somewhere else <br />
</p>
