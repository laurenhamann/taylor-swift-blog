<p className="verse-one">
No words appear before me in the aftermath <br />
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears <br />
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness <br />
'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye <br />
You were bigger than the whole sky <br />
You were more than just a short time <br />
And I've got a lot to pine about <br />
I've got a lot to live without <br />
I'm never gonna meet <br />
What could've been, would've been <br />
What should've been you <br />
What could've been, would've been you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia? <br />
Did some force take you because I didn't pray? <br />
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes <br />
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be <br />
So I'll say words I don't believe <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye <br />
You were bigger than the whole sky <br />
You were more than just a short time <br />
And I've got a lot to pine about <br />
I've got a lot to live without <br />
I'm never gonna meet <br />
What could've been, would've been <br />
What should've been you <br />
What could've been, would've been <br />
What should've been you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
(What could've been, would've been) <br />
What could've been, would've been you <br />
(Could've been, would've been) <br />
(Could've been, would've been) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye <br />
You were bigger than the whole sky <br />
You were more than just a short time <br />
And I've got a lot to pine about <br />
I've got a lot to live without <br />
I'm never gonna meet <br />
What could've been, would've been <br />
What should've been you <br />
