# Best Choruses

1. Karma - <br>

   > _'Cause karma is my boyfriend <br>Karma is a god <br>Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend <br>Karma's a relaxing thought <br>Aren't you envious that for you it's not? <br>Sweet like honey, **karma is a cat <br>Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me <br>Flexing like a goddamn acrobat** <br>Me and karma vibe like that_ <br>

2. Midnight Rain - <br>

   > _He was sunshine, I was midnight rain <br>He wanted it comfortable I wanted that pain <br>He wanted a bride **I was making my own name <br>Chasing that fame** He stayed the same <br>All of me changed like midnight_ <br>

3. Glitch - <br>

   > _I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah <br>Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah <br>**And I'm not even sorry <br>Nights are so starry, blood moonlit** <br>It must be counterfeit <br>I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah_ <br>

4. Bigger than the Whole Sky - <br>

   > _Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye <br>You were bigger than the whole sky <br>**You were more than just a short time** <br>And I've got a lot to pine about <br>I've got a lot to live without <br>I'm never gonna meet <br>What could've been, would've been <br>What should've been you <br>What could've been, would've been you_ <br>

5. Vigilante Shit - <br>

   > \*I don't start it but I can tell you how it ends <br>Don't get sad, get even <br>So on the weekends <br>I don't dress for friends <br>**Lately I've been dressing for revenge\*** <br>

6. Anti-Hero - <br>

   > _It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me <br>At tea time, everybody agrees <br>**I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror** <br>It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero_ <br>

7. Maroon - <br>

   > _The burgundy on my T-shirt when you splashed your wine into me <br>And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was <br>The mark you saw on my collarbone, **the rust that grew between telephones** <br>The lips I used to call home, so scarlet, it was maroon_ <br>

8. Lavender Haze - <br>

   > \*I feel a lavender haze creeping up on me <br>So real, **I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say** <br>No deal, the 1950s shit they want from me <br>I just wanna stay in that lavender haze <br>(Ooh, ooh, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa)

9. Bejeweled - <br>

   > _Best believe I'm still bejeweled <br>When I walk in the room <br>I can still make the whole place shimmer <br>And when I meet the band <br>**They ask, "Do you have a man?" <br>I can still say, "I don't remember"** <br>Familiarity breeds contempt <br>Don't put me in the basement <br>When I want the penthouse of your heart <br>Diamonds in my eyes <br>I polish up real, I polish up real nice_ <br>

10. Labyrinth - <br>

    > \*Uh oh, I'm falling in love <br>Oh no, I'm falling in love again <br>Oh, I'm falling in love <br>**I thought the plane was going down <br>How'd you turn it right around\*** <br>

11. Would've Could've Should've - <br>

    > _I would've stayed on my knees <br>And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil <br>At nineteen <br>And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven <br>**And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts** <br>Memories feel like weapons <br>And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering_ <br>

12. Snow at the Beach - <br>

    > _And it's like snow at the beach <br>Weird but fucking beautiful <br>**Flying in a dream, stars by the pocketful** <br>You wanting me tonight feels impossible <br>But it's coming down, no sound, it's all around <br>Like snow on the beach_ <br>

13. Paris - <br>

    > - **I'm so in love that I might stop breathing** <br>Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling <br>No, I didn't see the news <br>'Cause we were somewhere else <br>Stumbled down pretend alleyways <br>Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne <br>I was taken by the view <br>Like we were in Paris, oh <br>Like we were somewhere else <br>Like we were in Paris, oh <br>We were somewhere else\* <br>

14. Sweet Nothing - <br>

    > _They said the end is coming <br>Everyone's up to something <br>I find myself running home to your <br>Sweet nothings <br>**Outside they're push and shoving <br>You're in the kitchen humming** <br>All that you ever wanted from me was <br>Sweet nothing_ <br>

15. Question ...? - <br>

    > _Can I ask you a question? <br>Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room? <br>And every single one of your friends was making fun of you <br>But fifteen seconds later they were clapping, too? <br>Then, what did you do? <br>Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? (Oh) <br>**Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight?** (Oh) <br>When she said it was too much <br>Do you wish you could still touch her? <br>It's just a question_ <br>

16. Mastermind - <br>

    > _What if I told you I'm a mastermind? <br>And now you're mine <br>**It was all by design** <br>'Cause I'm a mastermind_ <br>

17. High Infidelity - <br>

    > _High infidelity <br>**Put on your records <br>And regret me** <br>I bent the truth too far tonight <br>I was dancing around <br>Dancing around it <br>High infidelity <br>Put on your headphones <br>And burn my city <br>Your picket fence is sharp as knives <br>I was dancing around <br>Dancing around it_ <br>

18. You're own your own, Kid - <br>

    > \*You're on your own, kid <br>**You always have been\*** <br>

19. The Great War - <br>

    > - **All that bloodshed, crimson clover** <br>Uh-huh, sweet dream was over <br>My hand was the one you reached for <br>All throughout the Great War <br>Always remember <br>Uh-huh, tears on the letter <br>I vowed not to cry anymore <br>If we survived the Great War\* <br>

# Best Bridges

1. Karma - <br>

   > \*Ask me what I learned from all those years <br>Ask me what I earned from all those tears <br>Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here <br>(I'm still, I'm still here) <br>'Cause karma is the thunder <br>Rattling your ground <br>Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter <br>Karma's gonna track you down <br>Step by step from town to town <br>Sweet like justice, karma is a queen <br>Karma takes all my friends to the summit <br>**Karma is the guy on the screen <br>Coming straight home to me\*** <br>

2. Would've, Could've, Should've - <br>

   > \*If clarity's in death, then why won't this die? <br>Years of tearing down our banners, you and I <br>**Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts <br>Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first\*** <br>

3. Sweet Nothing - <br>

   > \*Industry disruptors <br>And soul deconstructors <br>And smooth-talking hucksters <br>Out glad-handing each other <br>And the voices that implore <br>"You should be doing more" <br>**To you, I can admit <br>That I'm just too soft for all of it\*** <br>

4. You're on your own, Kid - <br>

   > _The jokes weren't funny, I took the money <br>My friends from home don't know what to say <br>**I looked around in a blood-soaked gown <br>And I saw something they can't take away** <br>'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned <br>Everything you lose is a step you take <br>So make the friendship bracelets <br>Take the moment and taste it <br>You've got no reason to be afraid_ <br>

5. Bejeweled - <br>

   > _Sapphire tears on my face <br>Sadness became my whole sky <br>**But some guy said my aura's moonstone <br>Just 'cause he was high** <br>And we're dancin' all night <br>And you can try to change my mind <br>But you might have to wait in line <br>What's a girl gonna do? <br>A diamond's gotta shine_ <br>

6. Snow on the Beach - <br>

   > _I can't speak **afraid to jinx it** <br>I don't even dare to wish it <br>But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet <br>Now I'm All For You like Janet <br>Can this be a real thing? Can it?_ <br>

7. Dear Reader - <br>

   > \*Spilling out to you for free <br>But darling, darling, please <br>You wouldn't take my word for it <br>If you knew who was talking <br>If you knew where I was walking <br>To a house, not a home, all alone <br>'Cause nobody's there <br>**Where I pace in my pen and <br>My friends found friends who care <br>No one sees when you lose <br>When you're playing solitaire\*** <br>

8. Mastermind - <br>

   > _No one wanted to play with me as a little kid <br>So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since <br> To make them love me and make it seem effortless <br> **This this the first time I've felt the need to confess** <br>And I swear I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care_ <br>

9. Paris - <br>

   > - **I wanna brainwash you <br>Into loving me forever** <br>I wanna transport you <br>To somewhere the culture's clever <br>Confess my truth <br>In swooping, sloping, cursive letters <br>Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight <br>In my mind\* <br>

10. Vigilante Shit - <br>

    > \*Ladies always rise above <br>Ladies know what people want <br>Someone sweet and kind and fun <br>**The lady simply had enough\*** <br>

11. Maroon - <br>

    > \*And I wake with your memory over me <br> That's a real fuckin' legacy, legacy <br> And I wake with your memory over me <br> **That's a real fuckin' legacy to leave\***

12. Lavender Haze - <br>

    > _Talk your talk and go viral <br> **I just need this love spiral** <br> Get it off your chest <br> Get it off my desk_

13. Question ...? - <br>

    > - **Does it feel like everything's just like second-best after that meteor strike** <br>And what's that, that I heard, that you're still with her? <br>That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable <br>And right, but tonight\* <br>

14. Midnight Rain - <br>

    > _I guess sometimes we all get <br>Just what we wanted, just what we wanted <br>**And he never thinks of me <br>Except when I'm on TV** <br>I guess sometimes we all get <br>Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted <br>And I never think of him <br>Except on midnights like this_ <br>

15. Anti-Hero - <br>

    > \*I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money <br>She thinks I left them in the will <br>The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out<br>**"She's laughing up at us from hell"\*** <br>

16. Glitch - <br>

    > \*A brief interruption, a slight malfunction <br>I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing <br>**I thought we had no chance <br>And that's romance, let's dance\*** <br>

17. The Great War - <br>

    > _We can plant a memory garden <br>Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair <br>There's no morning glory, **it was war, it wasn't fair** <br>And we will never go back_ <br>

18. High Infidelity - <br>
