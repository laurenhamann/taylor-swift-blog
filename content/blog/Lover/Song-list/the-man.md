<p className="verse-one">
I would be complex <br />
I would be cool <br />
They'd say I played the ﬁeld before I found someone to commit to <br />
And that would be ok <br />
For me to do <br />
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I'd be a fearless leader <br />
I'd be an alpha type <br />
When everyone believes ya <br />
What's that like? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can <br />
Wondering if I'd get there quicker <br />
If I was a man <br />
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again <br />
'Cause if I was a man <br />
Then I'd be the man <br />
I'd be the man <br />
I'd be the man <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
They'd say I hustled <br />
Put in the work <br />
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve <br />
What I was wearing <br />
If I was rude <br />
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And they would toast to me, oh <br />
Let the players play <br />
I'd be just like Leo <br />
In Saint-Tropez <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can <br />
Wondering if I'd get there quicker <br />
If I was a man <br />
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again <br />
'Cause if I was a man <br />
Then I'd be the man <br />
I'd be the man <br />
I'd be the man <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
What's it like to brag about <br />
Raking in dollars <br />
And getting bitches and models <br />
And it's all good if you're bad <br />
And it's okay if you're mad <br />
If I was out ﬂashing my dollars <br />
I'd be a bitch, not a baller <br />
They paint me out to be bad <br />
So it's okay that I'm mad <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can <br />
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (you know that) <br />
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again) <br />
'Cause if I was a man (if I was a man) <br />
Then I'd be the man (then I'd be the man) <br />
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (as fast as I can) <br />
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (hey) <br />
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again) <br />
'Cause if I was a man (if I was a man), then I'd be the man <br />
I'd be the man <br />
I'd be the man (oh) <br />
I'd be the man (yeah) <br />
I'd be the man (I'd be the man) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
If I was a man <br />
Then I'd be the man <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
[It plays with perception.] If I had made all the same choices, all the same mistakes, all the same accomplishments, how would it read? - Taylor Swift
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
It was a song that I wrote from my personal experience, but also from a general experience that I’ve heard from women in all parts of our industry. And I think that, the more we can talk about it in a song like that, the better off we’ll be in a place to call it out when it’s happening. So many of these things are ingrained in even women, these perceptions, and it’s really about re-training your own brain to be less critical of women when we are not criticizing men for the same things. So many things that men do, you know, can be phoned-in that cannot be phoned-in for us. We have to really — God, we have to curate and cater everything, but we have to make it look like an accident. Because if we make a mistake, that’s our fault, but if we strategize so that we won’t make a mistake, we’re calculating.

There is a bit of a damned-if-we-do, damned-if-we-don’t thing happening in music, and that’s why when I can, like, sit and talk and be like ‘Yeah, this sucks for me too,’ that feels good. When I go online and hear the stories of my fans talking about their experience in the working world, or even at school — the more we talk about it, the better off we’ll be. And I wanted to make it catchy for a reason — so that it would get stuck in people’s heads, so they would end up with a song about gender inequality stuck in their heads. And for me, that’s a good day. - Taylor Swift
