<p className="verse-one">
I remember when we broke up the first time <br />
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," <br />
'cause like <br />
We hadn't seen each other in a month <br />
When you said you needed space. (What?) <br />
Then you come around again and say <br />
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me." <br />
Remember how that lasted for a day? <br />
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you." <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Ooh, we called it off again last night <br />
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We are never ever ever getting back together <br />
We are never ever ever getting back together <br />
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me <br />
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together <br />

Like, ever <br />

</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights <br />
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right <br />
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind <br />
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Ooh, you called me up again tonight <br />
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We are never, ever, ever getting back together <br />
We are never, ever, ever getting back together <br />
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends,  <br />
talk to me (talk to me) <br />
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together <br />
</p>
Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah <br />
Oh oh oh <br />
<p className="bridge">
I used to think that we were forever ever <br />
And I used to say, "Never say never..." <br />
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you," <br />
And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting,  <br />
you know, like <br />
We are never getting back together. Like, ever" <br />

No! <br />

</p>
<p className="chorus">
We are never ever ever getting back together <br />
We are never ever ever getting back together <br />
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me <br />
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together <br />
We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh <br />
We, ooh, getting back together <br />
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends,  <br />
talk to me (talk to me) <br />
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together <br />
</p>
