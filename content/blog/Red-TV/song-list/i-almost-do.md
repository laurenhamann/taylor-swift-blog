<p className="verse-one">
I bet <br />
This time of night you're still up <br />
I bet <br />
You're tired from a long hard week <br />
I bet <br />
You're sittin' in your chair by the window <br />
Looking out at the city <br />
And I bet <br />
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I just wanna tell you <br />
It takes everything in me not to call you <br />
And I wish I could run to you <br />
And I hope you know that every time I don't  <br />
I almost do <br />
I almost do <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I bet <br />
You think I either moved on or hate you <br />
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply <br />
I bet <br />
It never ever occurred to you <br />
That I can't say "Hello" to you <br />
And risk another goodbye <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I just wanna tell you <br />
It takes everything in me not to call you <br />
And I wish I could run to you <br />
And I hope you know that every time I don't <br />
I almost do <br />
I almost do <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe <br />
It's probably better off this way <br />
And I confess, babe <br />
In my dreams you're touching my face <br />
And asking me if I wanna try again with you <br />
And I almost do <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I just wanna tell you <br />
It takes everything in me, not to call you <br />
And I wish I could run to you <br />
And I hope you know that every time I don't <br />
I almost do <br />
I almost do <br />
Uh-uh-uh <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I bet <br />
This time of night you're still up <br />
I bet <br />
You're tired from a long hard week <br />
I bet <br />
You're sittin' in your chair by the window <br />
Looking out at the city <br />
And I hope <br />
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me  <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
“I Almost Do” is a song I wrote about the conflict that you feel when you want to take someone back, and you want to give it another try, but you know you can’t. And you can’t because you know it’s hurt you so deeply that you know that you couldn’t bear to go through that again. So you’re sitting there and wondering where they are and hope that they think about you and that you’re almost picking up the phone call, but you just can’t. I think I needed to write this song in order to not call that person actually. I think that writing the song was what I did instead of picking up the phone. - Taylor Swift
