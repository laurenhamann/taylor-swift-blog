<p className="verse-one">
I was reminiscing just the other day <br />
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away <br />
Back to a first glance feeling on New York time <br />
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme <br />
Took off faster than a green light, go <br />
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know <br />
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made <br />
And that was the first day <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And darling, it was good <br />
Never looking down <br />
And right there where we stood <br />
Was holy ground <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress <br />
We had this big wide city all to ourselves <br />
We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you' <br />
And for the first time I had something to lose <br />
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way <br />
And the story's got dust on every page <br />
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now <br />
And I see your face in every crowd <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause darling, it was good <br />
Never looking down <br />
And right there where we stood <br />
Was holy ground <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Tonight I'm gonna dance <br />
For all that we've been through <br />
But I don't wanna dance <br />
If I'm not dancing with you <br />
Tonight I'm gonna dance <br />
Like you were in this room <br />
But I don't wanna dance <br />
If I'm not dancing with you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It was good <br />
Never looking down <br />
And right there where we stood <br />
Was holy ground <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Tonight I'm gonna dance <br />
For all that we've been through <br />
But I don't wanna dance <br />
If I'm not dancing with you <br />
Tonight I'm gonna dance <br />
Like you were in this room <br />
But I don't wanna dance <br />
If I'm not dancing with you <br />
</p>
