<p className="intro">
Now go stand in the corner <br />
And think about what you did <br />
Ha! <br />
Time for a little revenge <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer <br />
And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him <br />
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause <br />
She took him faster than you can say sabotage <br />
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it <br />
I underestimated just who I was dealing with <br />
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum <br />
She underestimated just who she was stealing from <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
She's not a saint, and she's not what you think <br />
She's an actress, whoa <br />
She's better known for the things that she does <br />
On the mattress, whoa <br />
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys <br />
On the playground won't make you many friends <br />
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind <br />
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list <br />
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it <br />
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling <br />
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things <br />
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know <br />
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go <br />
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me <br />
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
She's not a saint, and she's not what you think <br />
She's an actress, whoa <br />
She's better known for the things that she does <br />
On the mattress, whoa <br />
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys <br />
On the playground won't make you many friends <br />
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind <br />
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey <br />
You might have him, but haven't you heard? <br />
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey <br />
You might have him, but I always get the last word <br />
Woah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
She's not a saint, and she's not what you think <br />
She's an actress, whoa <br />
She's better known for the things that she does <br />
On the mattress, whoa <br />
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys <br />
On the playground won't make you many friends <br />
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind <br />
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing? <br />
'Cause I don't think you do, oh <br />
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? <br />
I don't think you do, I don't think you do <br />
Let's hear the applause <br />
C'mon show me how much better you are <br />
See you deserve some applause <br />
'Cause you're so much better <br />
She took him faster than you can say sabotage <br />

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
I was 18 when I wrote [“Better Than Revenge.”] That’s the age you are when you think someone can actually take your boyfriend. Then you grow up and realize no one can take someone from you if they don’t want to leave. - Taylor Swift
