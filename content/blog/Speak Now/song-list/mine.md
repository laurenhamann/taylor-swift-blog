<p className="verse-one">
You were in college working part-time waiting tables <br />
Left a small town, never looked back <br />
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling <br />
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I say, "Can you believe it?" <br />
As we're lying on the couch <br />
The moment I can see it <br />
Yes, yes, I can see it now <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? <br />
You put your arm around me for the first time <br />
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter <br />
You are the best thing that's ever been mine <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together <br />
And there's a drawer of my things at your place <br />
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded <br />
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But we got bills to pay <br />
We got nothing figured out <br />
When it was hard to take <br />
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? <br />
You put your arm around me for the first time <br />
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter <br />
You are the best thing that's ever been mine <br />
Do you remember all the city lights on the water? <br />
You saw me start to believe for the first time <br />
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter <br />
You are the best thing that's ever been mine <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m. <br />
As everything was slipping right out of our hands <br />
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street <br />
Braced myself for the goodbye <br />
'Cause that's all I've ever known <br />
Then you took me by surprise <br />
You said, "I'll never leave you alone" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You said <br />
"I remember how we felt sitting by the water <br />
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time <br />
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter <br />
She is the best thing that's ever been mine" <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Hold on <br />
Make it last <br />
Hold on <br />
Never turn back <br />
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on) <br />
You are the best thing that's ever been mine <br />
Do you believe it? (Hold on) <br />
We're gonna make it now (hold on) <br />
And I can see it (yeah, yeah) <br />
I can see it now <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
This is a situation where a guy that I just barely knew put his arm around me by the water, and I saw the entire relationship flash before my eyes, almost like a weird science-fiction movie. After I wrote the song, things sort of fell apart, as things so often do. And I hadn’t talked to him in a couple months. And the song came out, and that day, I got an e-mail from him. And I was like, ‘Yes!’ Because that one was sort of half-confession and half-prediction or projection of what I saw. - Taylor Swift

<blockquote>
Lately I’ve had this bad habit of running away from love. Kind of getting to the place where it’s about to commit, and then you just, like, run in the opposite direction. ‘Mine’ is about the idea that I could find someone who would be the exception to that, someone who would be so sturdy and so much of a sure thing that I wouldn’t run from it. Sometimes I look back on a lot of examples that I’ve seen of love, long term, and a lot of times it doesn’t work out. There are goodbyes and people get really hurt, so I tend to be a little ‘run-awayish.’ But I’m never past hoping that at some point that could change. This song is the first single because it has this…there was this moment between Nathan [Chapman] and I, my producer, when I brought this song in and when we made this demo in one day in his basement and we just kinda looked at each other and we were like, ‘This is it. This is the one.’ - Taylor Swift
