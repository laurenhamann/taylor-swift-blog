<p className="verse-one">
You and I walk a fragile line <br />
I have known it all this time <br />
But I never thought I'd live to see it break <br />
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet <br />
And I can't trust anything now <br />
And it's comin' over you like it's all a big mistake <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Whoa, holding my breath <br />
Won't lose you again <br />
Something's made your eyes go cold <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted <br />
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Can't breathe whenever you're gone <br />
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Stood there and watched you walk away <br />
From everything we had <br />
But I still mean every word I said to you <br />
He will try to take away my pain <br />
And he just might make me smile <br />
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh, holding my breath <br />
Won't see you again <br />
Something keeps me holding on to nothing <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted <br />
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Can't breathe whenever you're gone <br />
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I know <br />
I know <br />
I just know <br />
You're not gone, you can't be gone <br />
No <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Something's gone terribly wrong, won't finish what you started <br />
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Can't breathe whenever you're gone <br />
Can't go back, I'm haunted <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, oh, oh, oh <br />
You and I walk a fragile line <br />
I have known it all this time <br />
Never ever thought I'd see it break <br />
Never thought I'd see it <br />
</p>

 ## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
‘Haunted’ is about the moment that you realize the person you’re in love with is drifting and fading fast. And you don’t know what to do, but in that period of time, in that phase of love, where it’s fading out, time moves so slowly. Everything hinges on what that last text message said, and you’re realizing that he’s kind of falling out of love. That’s a really heartbreaking and tragic thing to go through, because the whole time you’re trying to tell yourself it’s not happening. I went through this, and I ended up waking up in the middle of the night writing this song about it. - Taylor Swift
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I wanted the music and the orchestration to reflect the intensity of the emotion the song is about, so we recorded strings with Paul Buckmaster at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. It was an amazing experience – recording this entire big, live string section that I think in the end really captured the intense, chaotic feeling of confusion I was looking for. - Taylor Swift
