<p className="verse-one">
Last night I heard my own heart beating <br />
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs <br />
Six months gone and I'm still reaching <br />
Even though I know you're not there <br />
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby <br />
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through <br />
Maybe I've been going back too much lately <br />
When time stood still and I had you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come back, come back, come back to me like <br />
You would, you would if this was a movie <br />
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out <br />
Come back, come back, come back to me like <br />
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry <br />
I know that we could work it out somehow <br />
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I know people change and these things happen <br />
But I remember how it was back then <br />
Locked up in your arms and our friends were laughing <br />
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them <br />
Now I'm pacing up the hall, chasing down your street <br />
Flashback to a night when you said to me <br />
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you" <br />
Not before I knew how much I had to lose <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come back, come back, come back to me like <br />
You would, you would if this was a movie <br />
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out <br />
Come back, come back, come back to me like <br />
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry <br />
I know that we could work it out somehow <br />
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
If you're out there <br />
If you're somewhere <br />
If you're moving on <br />
I'll be waiting for you <br />
Wary, since you've been gone <br />
I just want it back the way it was before <br />
And I just want to see you back at my front door <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I say <br />
Come back, come back, come back to me like <br />
You would before you said it's not that easy <br />
Before the fight, before I locked you out <br />
But I take it all back now <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come back, come back, come back to me like <br />
You would, you would if this was a movie <br />
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out <br />
Come back, come back, come back to me like <br />
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry <br />
I know that we could work it out somehow <br />
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You'd be here by now <br />
Is that the kind of ending you wanna see now? <br />
Baby, I don't like the ending <br />
Oh, I thought you'd be here now, whoa <br />
Thought you'd be here by now <br />
 <br />
</p>
