<p className="verse-one">
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us <br />
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly <br />
People would say they're the lucky ones <br />
I used to know my place was a spot next to you <br />
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat <br />
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh, a simple complication <br />
Miscommunications lead to fall out <br />
So many things that I wish you knew <br />
So many walls up, I can't break through <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room <br />
And we're not speaking <br />
And I'm dying to know <br />
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah <br />
I don't know what to say <br />
Since a twist of fate, when it all broke down <br />
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
(Next chapter) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
How'd we end up this way? <br />
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy <br />
And you're doing your best to avoid me <br />
I'm starting to think, one day, I'll tell the story of us <br />
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here <br />
But you held your pride like you should've held me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending <br />
Why are we pretending this is nothing? <br />
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how <br />
I never heard silence quite this loud <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room <br />
And we're not speaking <br />
And I'm dying to know <br />
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah <br />
I don't know what to say <br />
Since a twist of fate, when it all broke down <br />
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
This is looking like a contest <br />
Of who can act like they care less <br />
But I liked it better when you were on my side <br />
The battle's in your hands now <br />
But I would lay my armor down <br />
If you say you'd rather love than fight <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
So many things that you wish I knew <br />
But the story of us might be ending soon <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room <br />
And we're not speaking <br />
And I'm dying to know <br />
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah <br />
But I don't know what to say <br />
Since a twist of fate, when it all broke down <br />
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now <br />
And we're not speaking <br />
And I'm dying to know <br />
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah <br />
I don't know what to say <br />
Since a twist of fate, 'cause we're going down <br />
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
The end

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
I was at an awards show, and there was a guy there, obviously — it all starts there, doesn’t it? It was a guy I had been in a relationship with, falling out, then we end up at the same awards show, both trying to act like we don’t care, both like, you know, chatting up the people next to us. Afterward, I just felt so empty, like we were both fighting this silent war of pretending we didn’t care that the other was there. And I went home, and I wrote this song about it. And at that point, I had this gut feeling, and I knew the album was finished.
- Taylor Swift

<blockquote>
‘The Story of Us’ is about running into someone I had been in a relationship with at an awards show, and we were seated a few seats away from each other. I just wanted to say to him, ‘Is this killing you? Because it’s killing me.’ But I didn’t. But I couldn’t. Because we both had these silent shields up. I went home and I sat there at the kitchen table and I said to my mom, ‘I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room.’ Then I got up and ran into my bedroom, as she’s seen me do many times. And she probably assumed I had come up with a line in the song. - Taylor Swift
