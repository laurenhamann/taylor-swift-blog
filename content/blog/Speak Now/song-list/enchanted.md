<p className="verse-one">
There I was again tonight <br />
Forcing laughter, faking smiles <br />
Same old tired, lonely place <br />
Walls of insincerity <br />
Shifting eyes and vacancy <br />
Vanished when I saw your face <br />
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?" <br />
Across the room, your silhouette <br />
Starts to make its way to me <br />
The playful conversation starts <br />
Counter all your quick remarks <br />
Like passing notes in secrecy <br />
And it was enchanting to meet you <br />
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go <br />
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home <br />
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew <br />
I was enchanted to meet you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
The lingering question kept me up <br />
2 a.m., who do you love? <br />
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake <br />
And now I'm pacing back and forth <br />
Wishing you were at my door <br />
I'd open up and you would say <br />
Hey, it was enchanting to meet you <br />
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go <br />
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home <br />
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew... <br />
This night is flawless, don't you let it go <br />
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone <br />
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew <br />
I was enchanted to meet you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
This is me praying that <br />
This was the very first page <br />
Not where the story line ends <br />
My thoughts will echo your name <br />
Until I see you again <br />
These are the words I held back <br />
As I was leaving too soon <br />
I was enchanted to meet you <br />
Please don't be in love with someone else <br />
Please don't have somebody waiting on you <br />
Please don't be in love with someone else <br />
Please don't have somebody waiting on you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go <br />
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home <br />
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew <br />
This night is flawless, don't you let it go <br />
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone <br />
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew <br />
I was enchanted to meet you <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Please don't be in love with someone else <br />
Please don't have somebody waiting on you <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
I started writing that in the hotel room when I got back, because it was just this positive, wistful feeling of ‘I hope you understand just how much I loved meeting you.’ Using the word ‘wonderstruck’ [in the lyrics] was done on purpose, because that’s a word which that person used one time in an e-mail … so I purposely wrote it in the song, so he would know - Taylor Swift
