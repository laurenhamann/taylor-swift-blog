<p className="verse-one">
Tall, dark, and Superman <br />
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away <br />
To save the world or go to work <br />
It's the same thing to me <br />
He's got his mothers eyes, his father's ambition <br />
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him <br />
I hang on every word that you say <br />
And you smile and say, "How are you?" <br />
I'll say, "Just fine" <br />
I always forget to tell you <br />
I love you, I love you forever <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I watch superman fly away <br />
You've got a busy day today <br />
Go save the world, I'll be around <br />
And I watch superman fly away <br />
Come back, I'll be with you someday <br />
I'll be right here on the ground <br />
When you come back down <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Tall, dark and beautiful <br />
He's complicated, he's irrational <br />
But I hope someday you take me away and save the day, yeah <br />
Something in his deep brown eyes has me singing <br />
He's not all bad like his reputation <br />
And I can't hear one single word they said <br />
And you leave, got places to be and I'll be okay <br />
I always forget to tell you I love you <br />
I loved you from the very first day <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I watch superman fly away <br />
You've got a busy day today <br />
Go save the world I'll be around <br />
And I watch superman fly away <br />
Come back, I'll be with you someday <br />
I'll be right here on the ground <br />
When you come back down <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I watch you fly around the world <br />
And I hope you don't save some other girl <br />
Don't forget, don't forget about me <br />
I'm far away but I'll never let you go <br />
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window <br />
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you <br />
Wishing the card was from you <br />
Wishing the call was from you <br />
'Cause I've loved you from the very first day <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I watch superman fly away <br />
You've got a busy day today <br />
Go save the world, I'll be around <br />
Forever and ever here <br />
I watch superman fly away <br />
I swear, I'll be with you someday <br />
I'll be right here on the ground <br />
When you come back down <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
La, la, la, la, la, la <br />
La, la, la, la, la, la <br />
When you come back down <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
This is about, well, a guy, as usual. This was a guy that I was sort of enamored with. This song got its title by something that I just said randomly in conversatio. When he walked out of the room, I turned to one of my friends and said, ‘It’s like watching Superman fly away.’ - Taylor Swift
