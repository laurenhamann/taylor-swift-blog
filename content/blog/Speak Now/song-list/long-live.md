<p className="verse-one">
I said remember this moment in the back of my mind <br />
The time we stood with our shaking hands <br />
The crowds in stands went wild <br />
We were the Kings and the Queens <br />
And they read off our names <br />
The night you danced like you knew our lives <br />
Would never be the same <br />
You held your head like a hero <br />
On a history book page <br />
It was the end of a decade <br />
But the start of an age <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Long live the walls we crashed through <br />
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you <br />
I was screaming long live all the magic we made <br />
And bring on all the pretenders <br />
One day, we will be remembered <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I said remember this feeling <br />
I passed the pictures around <br />
Of all the years that we stood there <br />
On the sidelines wishing for right now <br />
We are the Kings and the Queens <br />
You traded your baseball cap for a crown <br />
When they gave us our trophies <br />
And we held them up for our town <br />
And The Cynics were outraged <br />
Screaming, "This is absurd!" <br />
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans  <br />
Got to rule the world <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Long live the walls we crashed through <br />
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you <br />
I was screaming long live all the magic we made <br />
And bring on all the pretenders <br />
I'm not afraid <br />
Long live all the mountains we moved <br />
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you <br />
I was screaming long live that look on your face <br />
And bring on all the pretenders <br />
One day, we will be remembered <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Hold on to spinning around <br />
Confetti falls to the ground <br />
May these memories break our fall <br />
Will you take a moment <br />
Promise me this <br />
That you'll stand by me forever <br />
But if —God forbid— fate should step in <br />
And force us into a goodbye <br />
If you have children some day <br />
When they point to the pictures <br />
Please tell 'em my name <br />
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild <br />
Tell 'em how I hope they shine <br />
Long live the walls we crashed through <br />
I had the time of my life, with you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Long, long live the walls we crashed through <br />
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you <br />
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made <br />
And bring on all the pretenders <br />
I'm not afraid <br />
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved <br />
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you <br />
And long, long live that look on your face <br />
And bring on all the pretenders <br />
One day, we will be remembered <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
This song is about my band, and my producer, and all the people who have helped us build this brick by brick. The fans, the people who I feel that we are all in this together, this song talks about the triumphant moments that we’ve had in the last two years. We’ve had times where we just jump up and down, and dance like we don’t care how we’re dancing, and just scream at the top of our lungs, “How is this happening?” And, I feel very lucky to even have had one of those moments, nonetheless all the ones that I got to have. ‘Long Live’ is about how I feel reflecting on it. - Taylor Swift
