<p className="verse-one">
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm <br />
And I'm a house of cards <br />
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running <br />
But I kinda know that I won't get far <br />
And you stood there in front of me just <br />
Close enough to touch <br />
Close enough to hope you couldn't see <br />
What I was thinking of <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Drop everything now <br />
Meet me in the pouring rain <br />
Kiss me on the sidewalk <br />
Take away the pain <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Get me with those green eyes, baby <br />
As the lights go down <br />
Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile <br />
My mind forgets to remind me, you're a bad idea <br />
You touch me once and it's really something <br />
You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be <br />
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world <br />
But with you I know its no good <br />
And I could wait patiently <br />
But I really wish you would <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Drop everything now <br />
Meet me in the pouring rain <br />
Kiss me on the sidewalk <br />
Take away the pain <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile <br />
Get me with those green eyes, baby <br />
As the lights go down <br />
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I run my fingers through your hair <br />
And watch the lights go wild <br />
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me <br />
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right <br />
And lead me up the staircase <br />
Won't you whisper soft and slow <br />
And I'm captivated by you baby <br />
Like a fireworks show <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Drop everything now <br />
Meet me in the pouring rain <br />
Kiss me on the sidewalk <br />
Take away the pain <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile <br />
Get me with those green eyes, baby <br />
As the lights go down <br />
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
When sparks fly oh baby smile <br />
When sparks fly <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
The song ‘Sparks Fly’ is about falling for someone that you maybe shouldn’t fall for, but you can‘t stop yourself because there’s such a connection, there’s such chemistry. This is a song that I wrote a few years ago and had been working on it ever since in the last two years and just honing in on little lyrics and changing them, so it’s really been awesome to see it change over the years. - Taylor Swift
