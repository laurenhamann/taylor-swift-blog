<p className="verse-one">
Long were the nights when my <br />
Days once revolved around you <br />
Counting my footsteps <br />
Praying the floor won't fall through, again <br />
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore <br />
I was fine <br />
You paint me blue sky <br />
Then go back and turn it to rain <br />
And I lived in your chess game <br />
But you changed the rules every day <br />
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone <br />
Tonight <br />
Well, I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Dear John <br />
I see it all now that you're gone <br />
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? <br />
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home <br />
I should've known <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Well, maybe it's me <br />
And my blind optimism to blame <br />
Or maybe it's you and your sick need <br />
To give love then take it away <br />
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors <br />
Who don't understand <br />
And I'll look back and regret <br />
I ignored when they said, "Run as fast as you can" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Dear John <br />
I see it all now that you're gone <br />
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? <br />
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home <br />
Dear John <br />
I see it all now, it was wrong <br />
Don't you think nineteen's <br />
Too young to be played by your dark, twisted games? <br />
When I loved you so <br />
I should've known <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You are an expert at sorry <br />
And keeping lines blurry <br />
Never impressed by me acing your tests <br />
All the girls that you've run dry <br />
Have tired, lifeless eyes 'cause you burned them out <br />
But I took your matches before fire could catch me <br />
So don't look now <br />
I'm shining like fireworks <br />
Over your sad empty town <br />
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Dear John <br />
I see it all now that you're gone <br />
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? <br />
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home <br />
I see it all now that you're gone <br />
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? <br />
The girl in the dress wrote you a song <br />
You should've known <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You should've known <br />
Don't you think I was too young? <br />
You should've known <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
The song ‘Dear John’ is sort of like the last email you would ever send to someone that you used to be in a relationship with. Usually people write this venting last email to someone and they say everything that they want to say to that person, and then they usually don’t send it. I guess by putting this song on the album I am pushing send.
- Taylor Swift

<blockquote>
I know it wasn’t good, so I don’t want to know. I put a high priority on staying happy, and I know what I can’t handle. It’s not that I’m this egomaniac and I don’t want to hear anything negative, because I do keep myself in check, but I’ve never developed that thick a skin. So I just kind of live a life, and I let all the gossip live somewhere else. If you go too far down the rabbit hole of what people think about you, it can change everything about who you are. - John Mayer
