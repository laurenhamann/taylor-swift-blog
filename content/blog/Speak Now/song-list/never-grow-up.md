<p className="verse-one">
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger <br />
And it's so quiet in the world tonight <br />
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreamin' <br />
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light <br />
To you, everything's funny <br />
You got nothing to regret <br />
I'd give all I have honey <br />
If you could stay like that <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up <br />
Don't you ever grow up <br />
Just stay this little <br />
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up <br />
Don't you ever grow up <br />
It could stay this simple <br />
I won't let nobody hurt you <br />
Won't let no one break your heart <br />
And no one will desert you <br />
Just try to never grow up <br />
Never grow up <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You're in the car on the way to the movies <br />
And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off <br />
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do <br />
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots <br />
But don't make her drop you off around the block <br />
Remember that she's gettin' older too <br />
And don't lose the way that you dance <br />
Around in your PJs getting ready for school <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up <br />
Don't you ever grow up <br />
Just stay this little <br />
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up <br />
Don't you ever grow up <br />
It could stay this simple <br />
And no one's ever burned you <br />
Nothing's ever left you scarred <br />
And even though you want to <br />
Just try to never grow up <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room <br />
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home <br />
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said <br />
And all your little brother's favorite songs <br />
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone <br />
So here I am in my new apartment <br />
In a big city, they just dropped me off <br />
It's so much colder than I thought it would be <br />
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on <br />
Wish I'd never grown up <br />
I wish I'd never grown up <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, I don't wanna grow up <br />
Wish I'd never grown up <br />
Could still be little <br />
Oh, I don't wanna grow up <br />
Wish I'd never grown up <br />
It could still be simple <br />
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up <br />
Don't you ever grow up <br />
Just stay this little <br />
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up <br />
Don't you ever grow up <br />
It could stay this simple <br />
I won't let nobody hurt you <br />
Won't let no one break your heart <br />
And even though you want to <br />
Please try to never grow up <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, oh <br />
Don't you ever grow up <br />
Oh (never grow up) <br />
Just never grow up <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
‘Never Grow Up’ is a song about the fact that I don’t quite know how I feel about growing up. It’s tricky. Growing up happens without you knowing it. Growing up is such a crazy concept because a lot of times when you were younger you wish you were older. I look out into a crowd every night and I see a lot of girls that are my age and going through exactly the same things as I’m going through. Every once in a while I look down and I see a little girl who is seven or eight, and I wish I could tell her all of this. There she is becoming who she is going to be and forming her thoughts and dreams and opinions. I wrote this song for those little girls. - Taylor Swift
