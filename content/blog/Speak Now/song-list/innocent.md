<p className="verse-one">
I guess you really did it this time <br />
Left yourself in your warpath <br />
Lost your balance on a tightrope <br />
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days? <br />
Always a bigger bed to crawl into <br />
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything <br />
And everybody believed in you? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's alright, just wait and see <br />
Your string of lights is still bright to me <br />
Oh, who you are is not where you've been <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Did some things you can't speak of <br />
But at night you live it all again <br />
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now <br />
If only you had seen what you know now then <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days? <br />
And everything out of reach <br />
Someone bigger brought down to you <br />
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep <br />
Before the monsters caught up to you? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's alright, just wait and see <br />
Your string of lights is still bright to me <br />
Oh, who you are is not where you've been <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
It's okay, life is a tough crowd <br />
32 and still growin' up now <br />
Who you are is not what you did <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Time turns flames to embers <br />
You'll have new Septembers <br />
Everyone of us has messed up too, ooh, ooh <br />
Minds change like the weather <br />
I hope you remember <br />
Today is never too late to be brand new <br />
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's alright, just wait and see <br />
Your string of lights is still bright to me <br />
Oh, who you are is not where you've been <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
It's okay, life is a tough crowd <br />
32 and still growin' up now <br />
Who you are is not what you did <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh <br />
It's never too late to get it back <br />
</p>

 ## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
You have to try really hard to regulate what you feel, what you let in, and what you don’t … but then when it comes to making an album, if you make everything general and kind of gloss over your actual, raw feelings, that doesn’t benefit anyone. As far as what to feel and what level to feel it, I can’t really control any of that. It’s just how things hit you, and what you let in is definitely something you’ve got to find a balance for. - Taylor Swift
