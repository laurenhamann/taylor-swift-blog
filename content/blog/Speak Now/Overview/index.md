## Side Note
This was the first Taylor Swift album that I bought. I had of course heard of her a bunch and knew all her hits but I am not a huge country music fan. I bought this album and listened to it constantly. At 15 years old, feeling the pain of Dear John and the butterflies of Enchanted. It was, and remains to be, a sparkly album. This album to me is her last wide-eyed look at the world. Lots of talk of magical, fantasy moments. Also, a lot of anger and rage. 
-- She wrote all these songs herself! Damn...

## [Chorus Ranking](#chorus-ranking)

1. [Enchanted](../Song%20List/enchanted.md)
<p className="chorus">
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go <br />
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home <br />
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew <br />
I was enchanted to meet you <br />
</p>

2. [Long Live](../Song%20List/long-live.md)
<p className="chorus">
Long live the walls we crashed through <br />
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you <br />
I was screaming long live all the magic we made <br />
And bring on all the pretenders <br />
One day, we will be remembered <br />
</p>

3. [Dear John](../Song%20List/dear-john.md)
<p className="chorus">
Dear John <br />
I see it all now that you're gone <br />
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? <br />
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home <br />
I should've known <br />
</p>

4. [Last Kiss](../Song%20List/last-kiss.md)
<p className="chorus">
I never thought we'd have a last kiss <br />
I never imagined we'd end like this <br />
Your name, forever the name on my lips <br />
</p>

5. [Back to December](../Song%20List/back-to-december.md)
<p className="chorus">
So this is me swallowin' my pride <br />
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night <br />
And I go back to December all the time <br />
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you <br />
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine <br />
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright <br />
I go back to December all the time <br />
</p>

6. [Ours](../Song%20List/ours.md)
<p className="chorus">
So don't you worry your pretty, little mind <br />
People throw rocks at things that shine <br />
And life makes love look hard <br />
The stakes are high, the water's rough <br />
But this love is ours <br />
</p>

7. [The Story of Us](../Song%20List/the-story-of-us.md)
<p className="chorus">
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room <br />
And we're not speaking <br />
And I'm dying to know <br />
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah <br />
I don't know what to say <br />
Since a twist of fate, when it all broke down <br />
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now <br />
</p>

8. [Mine](../Song%20List/mine.md)
<p className="chorus">
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? <br />
You put your arm around me for the first time <br />
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter <br />
You are the best thing that's ever been mine <br />
</p>

9. [Speak Now](../Song%20List/speak-now.md)
<p className="chorus">
Don't say yes, run away now <br />
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door <br />
Don't wait, or say a single vow <br />
You need to hear me out <br />
And they said, "Speak now" <br />
</p>

10. [Innocent](../Song%20List/innocent.md)
<p className="chorus">
It's alright, just wait and see <br />
Your string of lights is still bright to me <br />
Oh, who you are is not where you've been <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
</p>

11. [Never Grow Up](../Song%20List/never-grow-up.md)
<p className="chorus">
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up <br />
Don't you ever grow up <br />
Just stay this little <br />
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up <br />
Don't you ever grow up <br />
It could stay this simple <br />
I won't let nobody hurt you <br />
Won't let no one break your heart <br />
And no one will desert you <br />
Just try to never grow up <br />
Never grow up <br />
</p>

12. [Mean](../Song%20List/mean.md)
<p className="chorus">
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city <br />
And all you're ever gonna be is mean <br />
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me <br />
And all you're ever gonna be is mean <br />
Why you gotta be so mean? <br />
</p>

13. [If This Was a Movie](../Song%20List/if-this-was-a-movie.md)
<p className="chorus">
Come back, come back, come back to me like <br />
You would, you would if this was a movie <br />
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out <br />
Come back, come back, come back to me like <br />
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry <br />
I know that we could work it out somehow <br />
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now <br />
</p>

14. [Haunted](../Song%20List/haunted.md)
<p className="chorus">
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted <br />
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this <br />
I thought I had you figured out <br />
Can't breathe whenever you're gone <br />
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted <br />
</p>

15. [Sparks Fly](../Song%20List/sparks-fly.md)
<p className="chorus">
Drop everything now <br />
Meet me in the pouring rain <br />
Kiss me on the sidewalk <br />
Take away the pain <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile <br />
</p>

16. [Better Than Revenge](../Song%20List/better-than-revenge.md)
<p className="chorus">
She's not a saint, and she's not what you think <br />
She's an actress, whoa <br />
She's better known for the things that she does <br />
On the mattress, whoa <br />
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys <br />
On the playground won't make you many friends <br />
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind <br />
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha <br />
</p>

17. [Superman](../Song%20List/superman.md)
<p className="chorus">
I watch superman fly away <br />
You've got a busy day today <br />
Go save the world, I'll be around <br />
And I watch superman fly away <br />
Come back, I'll be with you someday <br />
I'll be right here on the ground <br />
When you come back down <br />
</p>
