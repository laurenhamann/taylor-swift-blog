Elevator buttons and morning air <br />
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs <br />
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares <br />
But right now my time is theirs <br />
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves <br />
They'll judge it like they know about me and you <br />
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do <br />
The jury's out, but my choice is you <br />
So don't you worry your pretty, little mind <br />
People throw rocks at things that shine <br />
And life makes love look hard <br />
The stakes are high, the water's rough <br />
But this love is ours <br />
You never know what people have up their sleeves <br />
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me <br />
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles <br />
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine <br />
And you'll say <br />
Don't you worry your pretty, little mind <br />
People throw rocks at things that shine <br />
And life makes love look hard <br />
The stakes are high, the water's rough <br />
But this love is ours <br />
And it's not theirs to speculate <br />
If it's wrong, and your hands are tough <br />
But they are where mine belong, and <br />
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith <br />
With this song for you <br />
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth <br />
And I love the riddles that you speak <br />
And any snide remarks from my father <br />
About your tattoos will be ignored <br />
'Cause my heart is yours <br />
So don't you worry your pretty, little mind <br />
People throw rocks at things that shine <br />
And life makes love look hard <br />
And don't you worry your pretty, little mind <br />
People throw rocks at things that shine <br />
But they can't take what's ours <br />
They can't take what's ours <br />
The stakes are high, the water's rough <br />
But this love is ours <br />
