I guess you really did it this time <br />
Left yourself in your warpath <br />
Lost your balance on a tightrope <br />
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back <br />
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days? <br />
Always a bigger bed to crawl into <br />
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything <br />
And everybody believed in you? <br />
It's alright, just wait and see <br />
Your string of lights is still bright to me <br />
Oh, who you are is not where you've been <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
Did some things you can't speak of <br />
But at night you live it all again <br />
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now <br />
If only you had seen what you know now then <br />
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days? <br />
And everything out of reach <br />
Someone bigger brought down to you <br />
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep <br />
Before the monsters caught up to you? <br />
It's alright, just wait and see <br />
Your string of lights is still bright to me <br />
Oh, who you are is not where you've been <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
It's okay, life is a tough crowd <br />
32 and still growin' up now <br />
Who you are is not what you did <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
Time turns flames to embers <br />
You'll have new Septembers <br />
Everyone of us has messed up too, ooh, ooh <br />
Minds change like the weather <br />
I hope you remember <br />
Today is never too late to be brand new <br />
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <br />
It's alright, just wait and see <br />
Your string of lights is still bright to me <br />
Oh, who you are is not where you've been <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
It's okay, life is a tough crowd <br />
32 and still growin' up now <br />
Who you are is not what you did <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
You're still an innocent <br />
Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh <br />
It's never too late to get it back <br />
 <br />
