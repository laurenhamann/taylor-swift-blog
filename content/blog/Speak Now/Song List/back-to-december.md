I'm so glad you made time to see me <br />
How's life? Tell me, how's your family? <br />
I haven't seen them in a while <br />
You've been good, busier than ever <br />
We small talk, work and the weather <br />
Your guard is up and I know why <br />
Because the last time you saw me <br />
Is still burned in the back of your mind <br />
You gave me roses and I left them there to die <br />
So this is me swallowin' my pride <br />
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night <br />
And I go back to December all the time <br />
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you <br />
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine <br />
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright <br />
I go back to December all the time <br />
These days, I haven't been sleepin' <br />
Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin' <br />
When your birthday passed and I didn't call <br />
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times <br />
I watched you laughin' from the passenger's side <br />
And realized I loved you in the fall <br />
And then the cold came, the dark days <br />
When fear crept into my mind <br />
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye <br />
So this is me swallowin' my pride <br />
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night <br />
And I go back to December all the time <br />
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you <br />
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine <br />
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind <br />
I go back to December all the time <br />
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile <br />
So good to me, so right <br />
And how you held me in your arms that September night <br />
The first time you ever saw me cry <br />
Maybe this is wishful thinkin' <br />
Probably mindless dreamin' <br />
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right <br />
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't <br />
So if the chain is on your door, I understand <br />
But this is me swallowin' my pride <br />
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night <br />
And I go back to December <br />
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you <br />
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine <br />
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright <br />
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind <br />
I go back to December all the time <br />
All the time <br />
