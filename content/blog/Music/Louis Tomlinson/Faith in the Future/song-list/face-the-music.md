<p className="verse-one">
Good and bad and right and wrong
Are stories made up when we're young to scare us
Love and hate are in-between
Depends on your reality to see them
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I just wanna stay in the moment the rest of my life
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So, one more night
I'm gonna choose
I don't wanna face the music, but I still wanna dance with you
Let's buy some time
For what we shouldn't do
I don't wanna face the music, but I still wanna dance with you
I still wanna dance with—
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Close your eyes and count to ten
If you're standin' on the edge of fallin'
Open up and looking down
Everything that matters is forgotten
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I just wanna stay in the moment the rest of my life
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So, one more night
I'm gonna choose
I don't wanna face the music, but I still wanna dance with you
Let's buy some time
For what we shouldn't do
I don't wanna face the music, but I still wanna dance with you
I still wanna dance with—
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So, one more night
I'm gonna choose
I don't wanna face the music, but I still wanna dance with you
Let's buy some time
For what we shouldn't do
I don't wanna face the music, but I still wanna dance with you
I still wanna dance with—
