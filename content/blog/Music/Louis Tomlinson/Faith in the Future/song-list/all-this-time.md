<p className="intro">
(One, two)
(One, two, three, four)
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
It's late now
I'm tryna find the words to say for ages
Just have patience
It's not how you spend the time, it's if you waste it
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I keep on building mountains hoping that they'll turn to gold
But the truth is, I still doubt that what I do can get me home
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When it gets cold
Oh, sometimes, sometimes, I lose my hope
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Our eyes meet
And I can tell that you're the same as me
It's the way we
It's the way we see ourselves through walls of trees
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And you keep on building mountains hoping that they'll turn to gold
But the truth is, you still doubt that what you do can get me home
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When it gets cold
Oh, sometimes, sometimes, you lose your hope
But the friends we make, the love it takes
It's worth, it's worth, it's worth the pain
The friends we make, the love it takes
It's worth, it's worth, it's worth it all this time
</p>
<p className="outro">
All this time
All this time
It's worth it all this time
</p>
