<p className="verse-one">
I came from a good home
A house full of terrace dreams
That was enough for me
You know, you had to see it to believe
</p>
<p className="refrain">
All the late nights, good times
The mistakes and the heartbreaks
When I get lost, I go
Back to where I started
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Common people, nothing's changed
You'll hear strangers singin' your name
If you act like you're one of us
If you act like you're one of us
Common people, not who you know
Just how far you're willin' to go
If you act like you're one of us
If you act likе you're one of us
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I took her to thе local
No deep pockets, but big hearts
Do you see what I see?
Now we're all out screamin' on the dance floor
</p>
<p className="refrain">
All the late nights and the good times
And the heartbreaks, the mistakes
When I get lost, I go
Back to where I started
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Common people, nothing's changed
You'll hear strangers singin' your name
If you act like you're one of us
Just act like you're one of us
Common people, not who you know
Just how far you're willin' to go
If you act like you're one of us
If you act like you're one of us
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Common people, nothing's changed
You'll hear strangers singin' your name
If you act like you're one of us
Just act like you're one of us
Common people, not who you know
Just how far you're willin' to go
If you act like you're one of us
Just act like you're one of us
</p>
<p className="outro">
Just act like you're one of us
</p>
