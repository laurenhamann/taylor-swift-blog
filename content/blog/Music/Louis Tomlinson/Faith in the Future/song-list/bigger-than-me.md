<p className="intro">
When somebody told me I would change
I used to hide behind a smile
When somebody told me I would change
I was afraid, I don't know why
'Cause so does the world outside, I've realised
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
I didn't read the signs
Walkin' different lines
I know I took a left
Tryna make it right
</p>
<p className="refrain">
All of these voices, all of these choices
I don't hear them anymore
Hear them anymore
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
When somebody told me I would change
I usеd to hide behind a smile
Whеn somebody told me I would change
I was afraid, I don't know why
'Cause so does the world outside, I've realised 
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And it's bigger than me
It's bigger than me
I've woken up from my sleep
It's bigger than me
It's bigger than me
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
So come on, call me "liar"
Yeah, you're so quick to judge
'Cause, yeah, I mighta changed
But everybody does
</p>
<p className="refrain">
All of these voices, all of these choices
I don't hear them anymore
Hear them anymore
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
When somebody told me I would change
I usеd to hide behind a smile
Whеn somebody told me I would change
I was afraid, I don't know why
'Cause so does the world outside, I've realised 
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And it's bigger than me
It's bigger than me
I've woken up from my sleep
It's bigger than me
It's bigger than me
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Do you ever ask why? It's not black and white
How you sleep at night when you're just like me
Ooh, 'cause I feel alive
Now I realise that the world outside
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And it's bigger than me
It's bigger than me
I've woken up from my sleep
It's bigger than me
It's bigger than me
</p>

It’s definitely the biggest sounding song I’ve got on the record, definitely the song that stands out as being one that should be a single. I wasn’t certain I was going to have one of these songs on this record that has a big chorus. It shows off my vocals, so I’m really proud of what we got out of it. - Louis Tomlinson
