<p className="verse-one">
Conversation is currency
Shapes become a language
Square eyes and sunglasses
Finding faces in the trees
Fabricated fairytales
Bring a new world to life
Sit down, sit down in the space and time
</p>
<p className="chorus">
She is beauty
And we are world-class (Oh)
Forever
We let the feeling last
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Escape the inevitable
Fade into light
Soak up the empathy
'Cause I’m with you tonight
Are we one or are we two?
Are we me or are we you?
Have we been all this before?
Do you see what I see?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
She is beauty
And we are world-class (Oh)
Forever
We let the feeling last
She is beauty
And we are world-class (Oh)
Forever
We let the feeling last
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
(Oh)
(Oh)
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Surrounded by light, surrounded by light
Surrounded by light, surrounded by light
Surrounded by light, surrounded by light
Surrounded, surrounded
Surrounded, surrounded by—
</p>
<p className="chorus">
She is beauty
And we are world-class (Oh)
Forever
We let the feeling last
She is beauty
And we are world-class (Oh)
Forever
We let the feeling last
</p>
<p className="outro">
Are we one or are we two?
Are we me or are we you?
Have we been all this before?
Do you see what I see?
</p>

“She Is Beauty, We Are world Class” is a thought provoking title. I’m not certain what it means to me. I’ve got an idea but it’s one of those phrases that I think is open to interpretation. Now Dave Sneedon, who I wrote this with […], he got the train down to [our] writing camp and in the toilet, written on the mirror was “She Is Beauty” […] and then below it, in a slightly different colored pen […] looks like someone finished it of and put “We Are World Class”.
He [Dave] just kind of came with this picture, he was like this is an interesting title. And that’s where the song kinda came from. - Louis Tomlinson
