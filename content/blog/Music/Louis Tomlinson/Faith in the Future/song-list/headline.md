<p className="verse-one">
Sometimes, I wake up and I hear you through the silence
You let your pride hide all your beauty and your kindness
So fast to judge in error, you thought you knew me better
So quick to kill forever
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You used to read me like a headline
So many reasons now you're not mine
Maybe if you'd taken more time
I'd still be the one you wanna talk to every night, oh
If you got in my head
You wouldn't be scared of what you'd find
You used to rеad me like a headlinе
Oh, that's the reason now you're not mine anymore
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You spent your summer workin' for your education
While I was runnin' after dreams that kept us waitin'
You never told me "never"
I guess I never knew we'd have the shortest forever
I thought I could, but I can't forget you
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You used to read me like a headline
So many reasons now you're not mine
Maybe if you'd taken more time
I'd still be the one you wanna talk to every night, oh
If you got in my head
You wouldn't be scared of what you'd find
You used to read me like a headline
Oh, that's the reason now you're not mine anymore
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
You used to read me like a headline
You used to read me like a headline
</p>
<p className="outro">
Sometimes, I wake up and I wish you were beside me
</p>
