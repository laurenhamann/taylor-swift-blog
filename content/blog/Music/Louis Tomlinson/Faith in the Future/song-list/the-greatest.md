<p className="verse-one">
Tell you I'm on my way
Nothing could make me late
Said I had a plan for us
Time, it came and changed it all
We had to disappear
’Cause nothing gets through here
Through that circle 'round my heart
Where the best of me should start
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I said you know me
Alone, we're only
Just as good as the rest 
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Together, we’re the greatest
We'll never be that cold again
No fallin' all to pieces
We're the grеatest
It's you and me until the еnd
Life for us is never over
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
The way you know something
Your face reminded me
Of a love you cannot hide
But don't need to tell me why
Back dancin' in the dark
Back to the very start
Findin' pieces that can fit
Making up for what we missed 
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I said you know me
Alone, we're only
Just as good as the rest 
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Together, we’re the greatest
We'll never be that cold again
No fallin’ all to pieces
We're the greatest
It's you and me until the end
Life for us is never over
Greatest
We'll never be that cold again
No fallin’ all to pieces
We're the greatest
It's you and me until the end
Life for us is never over
</p>

That was specifically written as a tour opener, not necessarily an album opener at the time. Musically, it’s interesting. There’s probably not another song like that on the record. It starts the album with a statement of intent, which I think is important. There’s a certain ambitious level to that. - Louis Tomlinson
