<p className="verse-one">
Maybe, maybe I don't believe that
Anything else could hurt me
If I don't want it to
Lately, lately it's been so easy
To see my life completed
Instead of half way full
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I know I'm the only one who's gonna make
My ship come sailing in
So I'm not gonna spend another night of dreaming
Of what could've been
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Keep your eyes on the horizon
Paradise is in your own mind anyway, anyway
Keep your head above the water
Paradise is getting closer everyday, everyday
Just get there your own way
Just get thеre your own way
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Calling, I hear forevеr calling
I'm gonna put my all in
There's nothing else to do
Wanting, I never want for nothing
But I've never wanted something
As much as I want you
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
So I'm not gonna spend another night of dreaming
Of what could've been
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Keep your eyes on the horizon
Paradise is in your own mind anyway, anyway
Keep your head above the water
Paradise is getting closer everyday, everyday
Just get there your own way
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I'm not gonna spend another night of dreaming
Of what could've been
Coz I know I'm the only one in charge of when
My ships come sailing in
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Keep your eyes on the horizon
Paradise is in your own mind anyway, anyway
Keep your head above the water
Paradise is getting closer everyday, everyday
Just get there your own way
Just get there your own way
</p>
