<p className="verse-one">
Here are some words I know that you don't wanna hear
"I think she's moved on, mate, it's almost been a year"
We haven't seen you here, we've given you your space
Pick up the phone 'cause now it's time you learnt to say
</p>

<p className="chorus">
That's the way, that's the way love goes
That's the way, that's the way love goes

</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Remember when you told me I should give it time?
Well, here's the chance for you to take your own advice
We're goin' out to end up somewhere we'll regret
'Cause in this town, it's easy to forget
</p>
<p className="chorus">
That's the way, that's the way love goes
I guess that's the way, that's the way love goes
When it cuts you, when you bleed
That's when you're feelin' it the most
That's the way, that's the way love goes
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
</p>

<p className="verse-three">
Here are the words I know that you don't wanna hear
"I think she's moved on, mate, it's almost been a year"
Not gonna ask you, but we'll make sure you're okay
Who cares? It's her loss anyway
</p>
<p className="chorus">
That's the way, that's the way love goes
That's the way, that's the way love goes
When it cuts you, when you bleed
That's when you're feelin' it the most
That's the way, that's the way love goes
That's the way, that's the way love goes
That's the way, that's the way love goes
When it cuts you, when you bleed
That's when you're feelin' it the most
That's the way, that's the way love goes
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
That's the way, that's the way love goes
</p>
