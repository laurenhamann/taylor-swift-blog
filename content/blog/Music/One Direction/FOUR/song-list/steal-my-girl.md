She been my queen since we were sixteen
We want the same things, we dream the same dreams
Alright, alright
I got it all 'cause she is the one
Her mum calls me "Love," her dad calls me "Son"
Alright, alright

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away

Kisses like cream, her walk is so mean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans

The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn
Alright, alright
