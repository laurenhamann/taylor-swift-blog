<p className="verse-one harry">
There's a lightnin' in your eyes, I can't deny <br />
Then there's me inside a sinking boat, runnin' out of time <br />
Without you, I'll never make it out alive <br />
But I know, yes, I know we'll be alright <br />
<em>There's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me</em> <br />
And every time I turn around, it's only gaining speed <br />
There's a moment when you finally realise <br />
There's no way you can change the rolling tide <br />
But I know, yes, I know that I'll be fine <br />
</p>

<p className="chorus all">
This time, I'm ready to run (Oh-oh) <br />
Escape from the city and follow the Sun <br />
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine? <br />
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night <br />
This time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh) <br />
Wherever you are is the place I belong <br />
'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young <br />
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run <br />
</p>

<p className="post-chorus all">
Ooh-ooh-ooh <br />
I'm ready to run <br />
Ooh-ooh-ooh <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
[Verse 2: Niall, <em>Louis</em>] <br />
There's a future in my life I can't foresee <br />
Unless, of course, I stay on course and keep you next to me <br />
<em>There will always be the kind that criticize
But I know, yes, I know we'll be alright</em> <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus all">
This time, I'm ready to run (Oh-oh) <br />
Escape from the city and follow the Sun <br />
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?<br />
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night <br />
This time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh) <br />
Wherever you are is the place I belong <br />
'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young <br />
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run <br />
