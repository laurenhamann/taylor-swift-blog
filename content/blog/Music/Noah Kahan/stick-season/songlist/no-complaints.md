<p className="verse-one">
I thought I had something <br />
And that's the same as having something <br />
I get mad at nothing, blame my dad for something <br />
I pull no punches, then feel bad for months <br />
Mm, thought I was raised better, tried to fake better <br />
Tried to blame weather and escape better <br />
Hope the skin heals where the pain enters <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh, but I finally got sewed up <br />
I set a time, then I showed up <br />
And, now, the weight of the world ain't so bad <br />
Mm-mhm <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I saw the end, it looks just like the middle <br />
I got a paper and pen and a page with no space <br />
I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication <br />
And forgot how to cry <br />
Who am I to complain? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
And now the pain's different <br />
It still exists, it just escapes different <br />
And evades vision, makes the rain different <br />
Makes the news boring, and my rage distant <br />
Yes, I'm young and living dreams <br />
In love with being noticed <br />
And afraid of being seen <br />
But I can finally eat <br />
And I can fall asleep <br />
It's fine, fine, fine <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I finally got sewed up <br />
I set a time, then I showed up <br />
And, now, the weight of the world ain't that bad <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Well, I saw the end, it looks just like the middle <br />
I got a paper and pen and a page with no space <br />
I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication <br />
Then forgot how to cry, who am I, who am I to complain? <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
To complain <br />
Oh, oh-oh, oh <br />
To complain <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I saw the end, it looked just like the middle <br />
I got a paper and pen, but I can't feel the pain<br />
I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication <br />
Then forgot how to cry <br />
Who am I to complain? <br />
</p>
