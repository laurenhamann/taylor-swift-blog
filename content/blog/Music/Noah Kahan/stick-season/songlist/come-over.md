<p className="verse-one">
I'm in the business of losin' your interest <br />
And I turn a profit each time that we speak <br />
Don't you know there's a coffin buried under the garden <br />
It was there when we got here, will be there when we leave <br />
And my house was designed to kinda look like its cryin' <br />
The eyes are the windows, the garage is the mouth <br />
So when they mention the sad kid <br />
In a sad house on Balch street <br />
You won't have to guess who they speakin' about <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come over <br />
Come over <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I'm in the process of clearin' out cobwebs <br />
I was takin' the wrong meds, feels good to be sad <br />
And my house is just barely big enough for my family <br />
But it feels like a fortress when the weather gets bad <br />
And my mouth was designed for my foot to fit in it <br />
Oh, the words, they went missin' when the stock market crashed <br />
And the Dow Jones keeps fallin', but I promise you, darlin' <br />
With the view in the morning, you won't ever go back <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come over <br />
Come over <br />
Come over <br />
Come over <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I know that it ain't much, I know that it ain't cool <br />
Oh, you don't have to tell the other kids at school <br />
My dad'll strike it rich, we'll be the big house on the block <br />
Someday I'm gonna be somebody people want <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
But I'm in the business of losin' your interest <br />
And I turn a profit each time that we speak <br />
Don't you know there's a coffin buried under the garden <br />
It was there when we got here, will be there when we leave <br />
