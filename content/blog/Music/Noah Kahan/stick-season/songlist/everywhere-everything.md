<p className="verse-one">
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br />
It's been a long year <br />
Would we survive in a horror movie? <br />
I doubt it we're too slow moving <br />
We trust everyone we meet <br />
Two bodies riddled with scars from our pre-teens <br />
Intertwine in a car's dirty backseat <br />
And stare at a drive-in screen <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
We didn't know that the sun was collapsing <br />
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing <br />
We cried oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you <br />
'Til we're food for the worms to eat <br />
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours <br />
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you <br />
'Til we're food for the worms to eat <br />
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br />
Drive slowly, I know every route in this county <br />
Maybe that ain't such a bad thing <br />
I'll tell where not to speed <br />
It's been a long year <br />
And all of our book's pages dog-eared <br />
We'll write out the ends on our palms dear <br />
Then forget to read <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
We didn't know that the sun was collapsing <br />
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing <br />
We cried oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you <br />
'Til we're food for the worms to eat <br />
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours <br />
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you <br />
'Til we're food for the worms to eat <br />
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you <br />
'Til we're food for the worms to eat <br />
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours <br />
</p>
