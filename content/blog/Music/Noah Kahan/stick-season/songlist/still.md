<p className="intro">
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye <br />
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
It only falls into place when you're falling to pieces <br />
You find love that lasts a while 'til you lose the reasons <br />
Sayin' God, I'm alive <br />
But the whole place is quiet <br />
You miss something that you can't place but you can't deny it <br />
Don't know whether you want a place in the coast or the country <br />
You can't stay here, it's hard to face and it feels too ugly <br />
You light a fire inside yourself, let it burn <br />
Stare up at a starless sky and you say <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's like I'm still here with you <br />
It's like I'm still here with you <br />
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
The past coming back with the light in the morning <br />
Look down on myself like a patient in surgery <br />
And I used to watch my mother move <br />
Like God was in the room <br />
It's a bottomless hole I've found out here with a trace of no one <br />
Grab a past box of photos, I rip myself open <br />
I'm in bed and I'm wondering <br />
If I'm callous but hoping <br />
Can I fix what is broken? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's like I'm still here with you <br />
It's like I'm still here with you <br />
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye <br />
It's like I'm still here with you <br />
It's like I'm still here with you <br />
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Oh-oh <br />
It's like I'm still here with you <br />
It's like I'm still here with you <br />
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye <br />
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say <br />
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say <br />
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye <br />
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say <br />
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say <br />
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
It only falls into place when you're falling to pieces <br />
You find love that lasts a while then you lose the reasons <br />
You say God, I'm alive <br />
But the whole place is quiet <br />
You miss something that you can't place but you can't deny it <br />
</p>
