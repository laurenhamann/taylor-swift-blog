<p className="intro">
Okay <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-one">
How have things been? Well, love, now that you mention it <br />
My folks still talk, but they speak in these two-word sentences <br />
I'm sayin' too much, but you know how it gets out here <br />
No winter coat could keep out all the cold of your atmosphere <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We once sang <br />
"Retrograde", we'd shake the frame of your car <br />
Now I know your name, but not who you are <br />
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood <br />
It's all my love, you got all my love <br />
I'm still out here with the pills and the dogs <br />
If you need me, dear, I'm the same as I was <br />
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood <br />
It's all my love, you got all my love <br />
You got all my love <br />

</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Write me a list of how it is, of how it was, of how it has to be <br />
You burrowed in under my skin, what I'd give to have you out from me <br />
But I still recall how the leather in your car feels <br />
And at the end of it all, I just hope that your scars heal <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We once sang <br />
"Retrograde," we'd shake the frame of your car <br />
Now I know your name, but not who you are <br />
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood <br />
It's all my love, you got all my love <br />
I'm still out here with the pills and the dogs <br />
If you need me, dear, I'm the same as I was <br />
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood <br />
It's all my love, you got all my love <br />
You got all my love <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Well, I leaned in for a kiss thirty feet from where your parents slept <br />
And I looked so confident, babe, I swear I was scared to death <br />
My hands gripped the wheel, I smiled stupid the whole way home <br />
Well, those five words in my head, you said, "I'll never let you go" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, I sang <br />
"Retrograde," we'd shake the frame of your car <br />
Now I know your name, but not who you are <br />
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood <br />
It's all my love, you got all my love <br />
And it's still out here with the pills and the dogs <br />
Wind chill this year stole the words from my tongue <br />
It's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood <br />
It's all my love, you got all my love <br />
You got all my love <br />
You got all my love <br />
You got all my love <br />
You got all my love <br />
</p>
