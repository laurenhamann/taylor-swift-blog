<p className="verse-one">
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined <br />
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive <br />
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign <br />
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right <br />
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face <br />
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace <br />
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains <br />
Doc told me to travel, but there's COVID on the planes <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks <br />
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed <br />
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim <br />
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas <br />
And I'll dream each night of some version of you <br />
That I might not have, but I did not lose <br />
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes <br />
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad <br />
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad <br />
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh <br />
You once called me "forever," now you still can't call me back <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks <br />
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed <br />
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim <br />
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas <br />
And I'll dream each night of some version of you <br />
That I might not have, but I did not lose <br />
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes <br />
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Oh, that'll have to do <br />
My other half was you <br />
I hope this pain's just passin' through <br />
But I doubt it <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks <br />
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed <br />
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim <br />
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas <br />
And I'll dream each night of some version of you <br />
That I might not have, but I did not lose <br />
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes <br />
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do <br />
Have to do <br />
