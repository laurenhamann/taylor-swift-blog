<p className="verse-one">
Breathin' in, breathin' out <br />
How you been? Settled down? <br />
You feelin' right? Feelin' proud? <br />
How are your kids? Where are they now? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You build a boat, you build a life <br />
You lose your friends, you lose your wife <br />
You settle in to routine <br />
Where are you? What does it mean? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
If I get too close and I'm not how you hoped <br />
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised out in the cold <br />
If the sun don't rise 'til the summertime <br />
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised on little light <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Bought some shit, search online <br />
You're gettin' lost, you're gettin' high <br />
All alone late in life <br />
Scared to live, scared to die <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You build a boat, you build a life <br />
You lose your kids, you lose your wife <br />
You settle down, you're feelin' lost <br />
You're gettin' stoned, then kickin' rocks (One, two, three, four) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
If I get too close and I'm not how you hoped <br />
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised out in the cold <br />
If the sun don't rise 'til the summertime <br />
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised on little light <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah <br />
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah <br />
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah (Oh) <br />
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah (Oh) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
If you get too close and I'm not how you hoped <br />
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised out in the cold <br />
If the sun don't shine 'til the summertime <br />
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised on little light <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Sick <br />
