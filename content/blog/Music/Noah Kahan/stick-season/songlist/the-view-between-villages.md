<p className="verse-one">
Air in my lungs <br />
'Til the road begins <br />
As the last of the bugs <br />
Leave their homes again <br />
And I'm splitting the road down the middle <br />
For a minute the world seemed so simple <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Feel the rush of my blood <br />
I'm seventeen again <br />
I am not scared of death <br />
I've got dreams again <br />
It's just me and the curve of the valley <br />
And there is meaning on Earth, I am happy <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
(Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Passed Alger Brook road, I'm over the bridge <br />
A minute from home, but I feel so far from it <br />
The death of my dog, the stretch of my skin <br />
It's all washin' over me, I'm angry again <br />
The things that I lost here, the people I knew <br />
They got me surrounded for a mile or two <br />
The cars in reverse, I'm grippin' the wheel <br />
I'm back between villages and everything's still <br />
</p>
