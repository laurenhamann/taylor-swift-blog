<p className="verse-one">
Honey, come over <br />
The party's gone slower <br />
And no one will tempt you <br />
We know you got sober <br />
There's orange juice in the kitchen <br />
Bought for the children <br />
It's yours if you want it <br />
We're just glad you could visit <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Feels like I've been ready for you to come home <br />
For so long <br />
That I didn't think to ask you where you'd gone <br />
Why'd you go? <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
And you said <br />
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm-mm" <br />
And you said <br />
You said my heart has changed and my soul has changed <br />
And my heart, and my heart <br />
Now my face has changed, and I haven't drank <br />
In six months on the dot <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
See the graves as you pass through <br />
From our crash back in '02 <br />
Not one nick on your finger <br />
You just asked me to hold you <br />
But it made you a stranger <br />
And filled you with anger <br />
Now I'm third in the line up <br />
To your Lord and your Savior <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Feels like I've been ready for you to come home <br />
For so long <br />
That I didn't think to ask you where you'd gone <br />
So why'd you go? <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
And you said <br />
"Mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, mm" <br />
You said <br />
"Mm-hmm" <br />
You said my heart has changed and my soul has changed <br />
And my heart, and my heart <br />
That my life has changed, that this town had changed and you had not <br />
That the world has changed, don't you find it strange <br />
That you just went ahead and carried on? <br />
And you know I'd say, the last time I drank <br />
I was face down, passed out there in your lawn <br />
Are we all just crows to you now? <br />
Are we all just pullin' you down? <br />
You didn't put those bones in the ground <br />
You didn't put those bones in the ground <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Honey, come over <br />
The party's gone slower <br />
And no one will tempt you <br />
We know you got sober <br />
There's orange juice in the kitchen <br />
Bought for the children <br />
It's yours if you want it <br />
We're just glad you could visit <br />
