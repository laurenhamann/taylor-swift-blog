<p className="verse-one">
Darling, speak to me but don't you say a word <br />
Light a cigarette, I'll watch it as it burns <br />
Remember telling me that you thought you were cursed? <br />
I'm in love with every song you've ever heard <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
If I could lose you, I would <br />
We buried your bones in plywood <br />
If I could lose you, I would <br />
We buried your bones in plywood <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I said love is fast asleep <br />
On a dirt road with your head on my shoulder <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Strawberry wine, and all the time we used to have <br />
Those things I miss but know are never coming back
For you, darling, for you <br />
No thing defines a man like love that makes him soft <br />
And sentimental like a stranger in the park <br />
For a few moments, I see you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
If I was empty space and you were a formless shape, we'd fit <br />
But love leaves little runway and every time we run straight over it <br />
If I was empty space and you were a formless shape, we'd fit <br />
But love leaves little runway and every time I run straight over it <br />
</p>

Ooh, ooh, ooh <br />
Ooh, ooh, ooh <br />
Ooh-ooh, ooh <br />
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh <br />
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh <br />
Ooh-ooh <br />
(Ooh, ooh) <br />
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) <br />
(Ooh, ooh) <br />
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) <br />
(Ooh, ooh) <br />
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Ooh <br />
(Ooh, ooh) <br />
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Ooh, ooh <br />
(Ooh, ooh) <br />
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) <br />
(Ooh, ooh) <br />
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) <br />
