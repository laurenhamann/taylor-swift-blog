<p className="verse-one">
Oh, you're spiralin' again <br />
The moment right before it ends you're most afraid of <br />
But don't you cancel any plans <br />
'Cause I won't let you get the chance to never make them <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Stayed on the line with you the entire night <br />
'Til you let it out and let it in <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't let this darkness fool you <br />
All lights turned off can be turned on <br />
I'll drive, I'll drive all night <br />
I'll call your mom <br />
Oh, dear, don't be discouraged <br />
I've been exactly where you are <br />
I'll drive, I'll drive all night <br />
I'll call your mom <br />
I'll call your mom <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Waiting room, no place to stand <br />
Just greatest fears and wringing hands and the loudest silence <br />
If you could see yourself like this <br />
If you could see yourself like this, you'd've never tried it <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Stayed on the line with you the entire night <br />
'Til you told me that you had to go <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't let this darkness fool you <br />
All lights turned off can be turned on <br />
I'll drive, I'll drive all night <br />
I'll call your mom <br />
Oh, dear, don't be discouraged <br />
I've been exactly where you are <br />
I'll drive, I'll drive all night <br />
I'll call your mom <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Medicate, meditate, swear your soul to Jesus <br />
Throw a punch, fall in love, give yourself a reason <br />
Don't wanna drive another mile wonderin' if you're breathin' <br />
So won't you stay, won't you stay, won't you stay with me? <br />
Medicate, meditate, save your soul for Jesus <br />
Throw a punch, fall in love, give yourself a reason <br />
Don't wanna drive another mile without knowin' you're breathin' <br />
So won't you stay, won't you stay, won't you stay with me? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't let this darkness fool you <br />
All lights turned off can be turned on <br />
I'll drive, I'll drive all night <br />
I'll call your mom <br />
Oh, dear, don't be discouraged <br />
I've been exactly where you are <br />
I'll drive, I'll drive all night <br />
I'll call your mom <br />
I'll call your mom <br />
</p>
