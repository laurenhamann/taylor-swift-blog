<p className="verse-one">
County line, I'm countin' down <br />
Mailboxes until my house <br />
This place had a heartbeat in its day <br />
Vail bought the mountains, and nothing was the same <br />
Yes, the boys are drunk, the sun is high <br />
Their license plates "Live Free or Die" <br />
But it just ain't that simple, it never was <br />
We'll drink 'til New Year's, then they'll leave me to clean up <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
One day, I'm gonna cut it clear <br />
Ride like Paul Revere <br />
And, when they ask me who I am <br />
I'll say, "I'm not from around here" <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I'll leave before the road crew's out <br />
Before those joggers, looking way too proud <br />
And I'll turn up the music and I'll forget <br />
Until it ends, that I'm not ready to let go yet <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
One day, I'm gonna cut it clear <br />
Ride like Paul Revere <br />
And, when they ask me who I am <br />
I'll just pretend I didn't hear <br />
It's typical, I fear <br />
Folks just disappear <br />
And, when they ask me who I am <br />
I'll say, "I'm not from around here" <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I'll say, "I'm not from around here" <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
But I'm in my car, and I see the yard <br />
The patch of grass where we buried the dog <br />
And the world makes sense behind a chain-link fence <br />
If I could leave, I would've already left <br />
But I'm in my car, and I see the yard <br />
And the patch of grass where we buried the dog <br />
And the world makes sense behind a chain-link fence <br />
If I could leave, I would've already left <br />
I would've already left <br />
</p>
