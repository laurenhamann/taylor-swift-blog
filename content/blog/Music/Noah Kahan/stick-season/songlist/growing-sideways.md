<p className="verse-one">
So I took my medication and I poured my trauma out <br />
On some sad-eyed, middle-aged man's overpriced new leather couch <br />
And we argued about Jesus, finally found some middle ground <br />
I said, "I'm cured" <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
And I divvied up my anger into thirty separate parts <br />
Keep the bad shit in my liver and the rest around my heart <br />
I'm still angry at my parents for what their parents did to them <br />
But it's a start <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But I ignore things and I move sideways <br />
'Til I forget what I felt in the first place <br />
At the end of the day, I know there are worse ways to stay alive <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause everyone's growing and everyone's healthy <br />
I'm terrified that I might never have met me <br />
Oh, if my engine works perfect on empty <br />
I guess I'll drive <br />
I guess I'll drive <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
So I forgot my medication, fell into a manic high <br />
Spent my savings at a Lulu, now I'm sufferin' in style <br />
Why is pain so damn impatient? Ain't like it's got a place to be<br />
Keeps rushin' me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But I ignore things and I move sideways <br />
'Til I forget what I felt in the first place <br />
At the end of the day, I know there are worse ways to stay alive <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause everyone's growing and everyone's healthy <br />
I'm terrified that I might never have met me <br />
Oh, if my engine works perfect on empty <br />
I guess I'll drive <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And if all my life was wasted <br />
I don't mind, I'll watch it go <br />
Yeah, it's better to die numb than feel it all <br />
Oh, if all my time was wasted <br />
I don't mind, I'll watch it go <br />
Yeah, it's better to die numb than feel it all <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But I ignore things and I move sideways <br />
Until I forget what I felt in the first place <br />
At the end of the day, Lord knows there are worse ways to stay alive <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause everyone's growing and everyone's healthy <br />
I'm terrified that I might never have met me <br />
Oh, if my engine works perfect on empty <br />
I guess I'll drive <br />
I guess I'll drive <br />
</p>
