<p className="verse-one">
I'm sailin' away to a place I'm afraid of <br />
The dawn isn't here, the sun hasn't rose <br />
I'm drinkin' my days with the coastal longshoreman <br />
They got money to make and children back home <br />
The last that I heard, you were down in New Orleans <br />
Workin' your days at The Print <br />
I drink 'til I drown and I smoke 'til I'm burnin' <br />
Your hands are all over my scent <br />
I worry for you, you worry for me <br />
And it's fine if we know we won't change <br />
Collect every dream in these old empty pockets <br />
In hope that I'll need them some day <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But the wreckage of you, I no longer reside in <br />
And the bridges have long since been burnt <br />
The ash of the home that I started the fire in <br />
It starts to return to the Earth <br />
I'm leavin' this town and I'm changin' my address <br />
I know that you'll come if you want <br />
It's not Halloween, but the ghost you dressed up as <br />
Sure knows how to haunt, yes, it knows how to haunt <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Mm-hmm-mm <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
It's an ode to the hole that I found myself stuck in <br />
A song for the grave that I dug <br />
There's a murder of crows in the low light off Boston <br />
And I see your face in each one <br />
I'm losin' myself in the tiniest objects <br />
I'm seein' my life on a screen <br />
I'm hearin' your voice in a strange foreign language <br />
If only I learned how to speak <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But the wreckage of you, I no longer reside in <br />
The bridges have long since been burned <br />
And the ash of the home that I started the fire in <br />
It starts to return to the Earth <br />
I'm leavin' this town and I'm changin' my address <br />
I know that you'll come if you want <br />
It's not Halloween, but the ghost you dressed up as <br />
Sure knows how to haunt, yeah, you know how to haunt <br />

</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Mm-hmm-mm (Ah-ooh, ooh) <br />
Know how to haunt <br />
Know how to haunt <br />
Mm-hmm-mm (Ah-ooh, ooh) <br />
Mm-hmm-mm (Ah-ooh, ooh, ooh) <br />
Ah, ooh <br />
Mm-hmm-mm (Ah-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I know that you fear that I'm wicked and weary <br />
I know that youâ€™re fearin' the end <br />
But I only tell the truth when I'm sure that I'm lyin' <br />
So I'm settin' sail once again <br />
</p>
