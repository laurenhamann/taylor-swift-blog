<p className="verse-one">
Oh, well, who was I <br />
Who was I to watch you wilt? <br />
You ain't gotta tell me what it means <br />
Trace the outlines of your dreams <br />
You'll always be a flower on my skin <br />
And the pain that I am in <br />
Mm, it's all the same <br />
The losing touch, the waiting game <br />
Cross that county line <br />
I promise to be there this time <br />
Alright? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You were a work of art <br />
That's the hardest part <br />
Howlin' like dogs in the light of the moon <br />
Holdin' our breath after 132 <br />
You asked me why I wasn't sayin' a word <br />
I'm naming the stars in the sky after you <br />
It was a work of art <br />
That's the hardest part <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
To spiral out, to try and float <br />
To see a friend, to see a ghost <br />
Bitter-brained, always drunk <br />
Rail-thin, Zoloft <br />
Subtle change, shorter days <br />
Dead-eyed, dead weight <br />
Your life, your dreams <br />
Your mind, your needs <br />
My needs <br />
Your needs, my needs <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Spiral out, try and float <br />
See a friend, see a ghost <br />
To see a ghost, see a ghost <br />
See a ghost <br />
</p>
