<p className="verse-one">
Ooh, silence is making me nostalgic <br />
Two sizes big your shirt in my apartment <br />
Oh, we were kids, but that don't make this less hard <br />
If I could fly I doubt I'd even do it <br />
I'd probably get high and crash or something stupid <br />
You made Ohio feel just like Central Park <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road <br />
Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes <br />
Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows <br />
And mine's full of receipts <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ooh, this town's for the record now <br />
The intersection got a Target <br />
And they're calling it downtown <br />
You and all of your new perspective now <br />
Wish I could shut it in a closet <br />
And drag you back down <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Gave me your word and now I can't pronounce it <br />
No thing so sure that I can't learn to doubt it <br />
Now the state bird, it sings our song so out of key <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road <br />
Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes <br />
Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows <br />
And mine's full of receipts <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ooh, this town's for the record now <br />
The intersection got a Target <br />
And they're calling it downtown <br />
You and all of your new perspective now <br />
Wish I could shut it in a closet <br />
And drag you back down <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And drag you back down <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road <br />
Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes <br />
Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows <br />
And mine's full of receipts <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ooh, this town's for the record now<br />
The intersection got a Target<br />
And they're calling it downtown<br />
You and all of your new perspective now<br />
Wish I could shut it in a closet<br />
And drag you back down<br />
And drag you back down<br />
And drag you back down<br />
