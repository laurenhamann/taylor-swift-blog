<p className="verse-one">
I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now <br />
But it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk <br />
And my medicine is drownin' your perspective out <br />
So I ain't takin' any fault <br />
Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be? <br />
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever <br />
It's all the same anyways <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown <br />
In the name of someone I no longer know <br />
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone <br />
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio <br />
I don't like that when they threw me in the car <br />
I gave your name as my emergency phone call <br />
Honey, it rang and rang <br />
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up <br />
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I'm untetherin' from the parts of me you'd recognize <br />
From charmin' to alarmin' in seconds <br />
I'll be bedridden, I'll let the pain metastasize <br />
But that's morning, I'll forget it <br />
And the dial tone is all I have <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown <br />
In the name of someone I no longer know <br />
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone <br />
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio <br />
I don't like that when they threw me in the car <br />
I gave your name as my emergency phone call <br />
Honey, it rang and rang <br />
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up <br />
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Well, I'd die for you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I beg you, sir, just let me call <br />
I'll give you my blood alcohol <br />
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell <br />
I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag <br />
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back <br />
"Son, are you a danger to yourself?" <br />
Fuck that sir, just let me call <br />
I'll give you my blood alcohol <br />
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell <br />
I'll change my faith, I'll kiss the badge <br />
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back <br />
"Son, why do you do this to yourself?" <br />

</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I said I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown <br />
In the name of someone I no longer know (I no longer know) <br />
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone <br />
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio <br />
I don't like that when they threw me in the car <br />
I gave your name as my emergency phone call <br />
Honey, it rang and rang <br />
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up <br />
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you <br />
