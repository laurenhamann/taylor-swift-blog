<p className="chorus">
Oh, there was heaven in your eyes <br />
I was not baptized <br />
Everything's alright when <br />
She calls me back, she calls me back <br />
Lost for a long time <br />
Two parallel lines <br />
Everything's alright when <br />
She calls me back, she calls me back (Yeah) <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-one">
Look at me and don't you lie <br />
I could be your sacrifice <br />
But don't you hold your head up high <br />
For bullshit, I do not have time <br />
I could be an old tattoo <br />
To remind me when I get bad news <br />
That I do not exist to die <br />
But live to die while saving you <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Does it bite at your edges? <br />
Do you lie awake restless? <br />
Why am I so obsessive? <br />
Hanging on to every sentence <br />
This town's the same as you left it <br />
Your page was blank, but I read it <br />
I still dial 822-993-167 <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, there was heaven in your eyes <br />
I was not baptized <br />
Everything's alright when <br />
She calls me back, she calls me back <br />
Lost for a long time <br />
Two parallel lines <br />
Everything's alright when <br />
She calls me back, she calls me back <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
The radio is taunting me <br />
Every song a minor key <br />
And I don't get much sleep most nights <br />
I'm seeing you in every dream <br />
If only I could wake you up <br />
If only I could fall asleep <br />
I'll love you when the oceans dry <br />
I'll love you when the rivers freeze <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Does it bite at your edges? <br />
Do you lie awake restless? <br />
Why am I so obsessive? <br />
Hanging on to every sentence <br />
This town's the same as you left it <br />
Your page is blank, but I read it <br />
I still dial 822-993-167 <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, there was heaven in your eyes <br />
I was not baptized <br />
Everything's alright when <br />
She calls me back, she calls me back <br />
Lost for a long time <br />
Two parallel lines <br />
Everything's alright when <br />
She calls me back, she calls me back <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
When she calls me back <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
All the pain I should have saved <br />
Oh, I was too afraid of <br />
Living life in your footsteps <br />
In your heart or in your head <br />
Oh, I was too afraid of <br />
Living life in your footsteps <br />
Living life in your footsteps <br />
Living life in your footsteps <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Still she calls me back <br />
Still she calls me <br />
</p>
