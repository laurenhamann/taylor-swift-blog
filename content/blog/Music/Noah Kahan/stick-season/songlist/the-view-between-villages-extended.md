<p className="verse-one">
Air in my lungs 'til the road begins <br />
As the last of the bugs leave their homes again <br />
And I'm splittin' the road down the middle <br />
For a minute, the world seemed so simple <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Feel the rush of my blood, I'm seventeen again <br />
I am not scared of death, I've got dreams again <br />
It's just me and the curve of the valley <br />
And there is meanin' on earth, I am happy <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh <br />
Oh, oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Passed Alger Brook Road, I'm over the bridge <br />
A minute from home, but I feel so far from it <br />
The death of my dog, the stretch of my skin <br />
It's all washin' over me, I'm angry again <br />
The things that I lost here, the people I knew <br />
They got me surrounded for a mile or two <br />
The car's in reverse, I'm grippin' the wheel <br />
I'm back between villages, and everything's still <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
"When I, for me personally <br />
I found a town big enough for anything that I want <br />
I mean, I'm not a city girl, ha-ha-ha, by any means" <br />
"Strafford, it still has a lot of meaning to me <br />
Because I grew up there <br />
Well, I guess it's a small— (Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah) <br />
A small community of, uh, people that really look out for each other (Ah, ah, ah) <br />
And that's the same way with anybody that needs anything <br />
This— this community is there to help" <br />
Ah, ah, ah <br />
Ah, ah, ah <br />
Ooh (Woah) <br />
Ah-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
The things that I lost here, the people I knew <br />
They got me surrounded for a mile or two <br />
Left at the graveyard, I'm driving past ghosts <br />
Their arms are extended, my eyes start to close <br />
The car's in reverse, I'm grippin' the wheel <br />
I'm back between villages, and everything's still <br />
</p>
