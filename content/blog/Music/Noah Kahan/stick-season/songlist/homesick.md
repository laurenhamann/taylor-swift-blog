<p className="verse-one">
Two months since you got back <br />
How have you been and are you bored yet? <br />
The weather ain't been bad <br />
If you're into masochistic bullshit <br />
And every photograph <br />
That's taken here is from the summer <br />
Some guy won Olympic gold <br />
Eight years ago, a distance runner <br />
And that makes a lot of sense <br />
This place is such great motivation <br />
For anyone tryna move <br />
The fuck away from hibernation <br />
Yoo-hoo <br />
Ooh, ooh-ooh <br />
Oh, no <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Well, I'm tired of dirt roads <br />
Named after high school friends' grandfathers <br />
And motherfuckers here <br />
Still don't know they caught the Boston bombers <br />
Time moves so damn slow <br />
I swear I feel my organs failing <br />
I stopped caring 'bout a month ago <br />
Since then it's been smooth sailing <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I would leave if only I could find a reason <br />
I'm mean because I grew up in New England <br />
I got dreams, but I can't make myself believe them <br />
Spend the rest of my life with what could have been <br />
And I will die in the house that I grew up in <br />
I'm homesick <br />
I'm homesick <br />
I'm homesick <br />
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I would leave if only I could find a reason <br />
I'm mean because I grew up in New England <br />
I got dreams, but I can't make myself believe them <br />
Spend the rest of my life with what could have been <br />
And I will die in the house that I grew up in <br />
I'm homesick <br />
I'm homesick <br />
I'm homesick <br />
I'm homesick <br />
Home <br />
</p>
