<p className="verse-one">
The only time I got to praying for a red light <br />
Was when I saw your destination as a deadline <br />
"This is normal conversation, babe, it's all fine" <br />
Making quiet calculations where the fault lies <br />
This is good land, or at least it was <br />
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
The college kids are getting so young, ain't they? <br />
They're correcting all the grammar on a spray paint <br />
And I even gave up driving after nightfall <br />
I got tired of the frat boys with their brights on <br />
This is good land, or at least it was <br />
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
It makes me smile to know when things get hard <br />
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far <br />
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far from here <br />
And, while I clean shit up in the yard <br />
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far <br />
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far, far from here <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So, pack up your car, put a hand on your heart <br />
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are <br />
We ain't angry at you, love <br />
You're the greatest thing we've lost <br />
The birds will still sing <br />
Your folks will still fight <br />
The boards will still creak <br />
The leaves will still die <br />
We ain't angry at you, love <br />
We'll be waiting for you, love <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
And we'll all be here forever <br />
And we'll all be here forever <br />
We sure will <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
We're overdue for a revival <br />
We spent so long just getting by <br />
That's the thing about survival <br />
Who the hellâ€” who the hell likes livin' just to die? <br />
You told me you would make a difference <br />
Well, I got drunk and shut you down <br />
It won't be by your own volition <br />
If you step foot outside this town <br />
But it's all we've had <br />
For always <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So, pack up your car, put a hand on your heart <br />
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are <br />
We ain't angry at you, love <br />
You're the greatest thing we've lost <br />
The birds will still sing <br />
Your folks will still fight <br />
The boards will still creek <br />
The leaves will still die <br />
We ain't angry at you, love <br />
We'll be waiting for you, love <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
And we'll all be here forever <br />
And we'll all be here forever <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You're gonna go far <br />
You're gonna go far <br />
You're gonna go far <br />
You're gonna go far <br />
Yes, you are <br />
(Ooh-ooh) <br />
If you wanna go far <br />
Then you gotta go far <br />
</p>
