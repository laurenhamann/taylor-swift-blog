<p className="verse-one">
Put a price on emotion <br />
I'm looking for something to buy <br />
You've got my devotion <br />
But man, I can hate you sometimes <br />
I don't want to fight you <br />
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt <br />
We'll get the drinks in <br />
So I'll get to thinking of her <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
Test of my patience <br />
There's things that we'll never know <br />
You sunshine, you temptress <br />
My hand's at risk, I fold <br />
Crisp trepidation <br />
I'll try to shake this soon <br />
Spreading you open <br />
Is the only way of knowing you <br />
</p>

<p className="chorus">
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be alright <br />
We'll be alright <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be a fine line <br />
We'll be alright (Alright, alright, alright) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
(We'll be alright) <br />
(We'll be alright) <br />
We'll be alright <br />
We'll be alright <br />
Oh <br />
</p>

The last song, “Fine Line”, the title track, which is track 12. It went through a lot of things to get to where it is now, and it’s a special song to me.
