<p className="verse-one">
Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you
</p>

<p className="chorus">
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright (Alright, alright, alright)
</p>
<p className="outro">
(We'll be alright)
(We'll be alright)
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
Oh
</p>

The last song, “Fine Line”, the title track, which is track 12. It went through a lot of things to get to where it is now, and it’s a special song to me.
- Harry Styles
