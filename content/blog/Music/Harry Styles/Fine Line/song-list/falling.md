<p className="verse-one">
I'm in my bed <br />
And you're not here <br />
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands <br />
Forget what I said <br />
It's not what I meant <br />
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What am I now? What am I now? <br />
What if I'm someone I don't want around? <br />
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <br />
What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <br />
What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <br />
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You said you cared, and you missed me too <br />
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you <br />
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe <br />
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What am I now? What am I now? <br />
What if I'm someone I don't want around? <br />
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin <br />'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <br />
What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <br />
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What am I now? What am I now? <br />
What if you're someone I just want around? <br />
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <br />
What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <br />
What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <br />
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/6SmM04jO1eQ">
I was showering and he [Tom] was playing on the piano, and as I came out of the shower he was playing the “dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun” [chorus]. I went and stood next to him at the piano – just in a towel, we kinda just wrote the whole thing.

The chorus says like “What am I now? Am I someone I don’t want around?” – it was a big moment where I was kind of asking myself – “What am I doing?” I kind of started to feel threads of where I could see myself becoming someone that I didn’t want to be.
