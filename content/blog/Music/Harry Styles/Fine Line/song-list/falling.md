<p className="verse-one">
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/6SmM04jO1eQ">
I was showering and he [Tom] was playing on the piano, and as I came out of the shower he was playing the “dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun” [chorus]. I went and stood next to him at the piano – just in a towel, we kinda just wrote the whole thing.

The chorus says like “What am I now? Am I someone I don’t want around?” – it was a big moment where I was kind of asking myself – “What am I doing?” I kind of started to feel threads of where I could see myself becoming someone that I didn’t want to be.
