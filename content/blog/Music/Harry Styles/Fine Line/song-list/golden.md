<p className="intro">
Hey!
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light
I know you were way too bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
Brown my skin just right
You're so golden

</p>
<p className="chorus">
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold)
I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control)
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote
Golden
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
</p>
<p className="bridge">
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
I know that you're scared because I'm so open
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
My favourite memory from making this album was the day we wrote ‘Golden’. We were all sat in the kitchen at [Rick Rubin’s recording studio] Shangri-La, having dinner, and we played it on one guitar while everyone sang around the table. It just felt really good. Part of the thing with the mushrooms for me is that I never do anything when I’m working. I don’t even drink when I’m working. I don’t drink really at all. And when I was in the band, to me it felt like it was so much bigger than any of us. I felt like, I’m not going to be the one who messes it up. So I thought, now is the time in my life when you go out and experiment. You take this and you do that. Making this record just felt… joyous. I was with my friends and we were in Malibu and I felt so safe. Now’s the time to have fun—we’re 24, and I’m in music. I’m not a politician. We wrote it on day two of being at Shangri-La, and immediately, as soon as we’d done it, it was like, ‘Oh, this is track one.’ I used to drive to the studio, and it’s the perfect PCH song. It’s like driving down the coast is what the song is for. It feels so Malibu to me.
- Harry Styles
