<p className="intro">
Hey! <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes <br />
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light <br />
I know you were way too bright for me <br />
I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky <br />
Brown my skin just right <br />
You're so golden <br />

</p>
<p className="chorus">
You're so golden <br />
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared <br />
Because hearts get broken <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I don't wanna be alone <br />
I don't wanna be alone when it ends <br />
Don't wanna let you know <br />
I don't wanna be alone <br />
But I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold) <br />
I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control) <br />
Of who I am, and all I've ever known <br />
Lovin' you's the antidote <br />
Golden <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You're so golden <br />
I don't wanna be alone <br />
You're so golden <br />
You're so golden <br />
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared <br />
Because hearts get broken <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
(Golden, golden, golden, golden) <br />
(Golden, golden, golden, golden) <br />
(Golden, golden, golden, golden) <br />
(Golden, golden, golden, golden) <br />
(Golden, golden, golden, golden) <br />
(Golden, golden, golden, golden) <br />
(Golden, golden, golden, golden) <br />
I know that you're scared because I'm so open <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You're so golden <br />
I don't wanna be alone <br />
You're so golden <br />
You're so golden <br />
You're so golden <br />
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared <br />
Because hearts get broken <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
My favourite memory from making this album was the day we wrote ‘Golden’.
<br />We were all sat in the kitchen at [Rick Rubin’s recording studio] Shangri-La, having dinner, and we played it on one guitar while everyone sang around the table. <br />
It just felt really good. Part of the thing with the mushrooms for me is that I never do anything when I’m working. <br />
I don’t even drink when I’m working. I don’t drink really at all. And when I was in the band, to me it felt like it was so much bigger than any of us. <br />
I felt like, I’m not going to be the one who messes it up. So I thought, now is the time in my life when you go out and experiment. You take this and you do that. Making this record just felt… joyous. I was with my friends and we were in Malibu and I felt so safe. <br />
Now’s the time to have fun—we’re 24, and I’m in music. I’m not a politician. We wrote it on day two of being at Shangri-La, and immediately, as soon as we’d done it, it was like, ‘Oh, this is track one.’<br />
I used to drive to the studio, and it’s the perfect PCH song. It’s like driving down the coast is what the song is for. It feels so Malibu to me.
