<p className="intro">
Sunflower
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers sometimes keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to talk to you
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)
</p>

<p className="chorus">
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
</p>
<p className="verse">
Wondering, headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste before I got to know you
I've got your face hung up high in the gallery
I love this shade, sunflower, sunflower
Your flowers just died, plant new seeds in the melody
Let me inside, I wanna get to know you
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to act a fool
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
I couldn't want you any more
Kids in the kitchen listen to dancehall
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers just died, keep it sweet in your memory
I'm still tongue-tied
Sunflower, sunflower
</p>
<p className="outro">
Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower, sunflower
Ayy, woo, ow
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Yeah!
Ooh, woo, ooh
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
</p>

I would love people to listen to the whole album. I want people to listen to every song. Even with streaming and playlists, I love listening to records top to bottom. So I want to make make albums that I want to listen to top to bottom, because that’s just how I listen to music.
