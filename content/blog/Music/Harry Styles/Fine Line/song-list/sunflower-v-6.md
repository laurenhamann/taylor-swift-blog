<p className="intro">
Sunflower <br />
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody <br />
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you <br />
Sunflowers sometimes keep it sweet in your memory <br />
I was just tongue-tied  <br />
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
I don't wanna make you feel bad <br />
But I've been trying hard not to talk to you <br />
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower) <br />
</p>

<p className="chorus">
I couldn't want you any more <br />
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor <br />
I couldn't want you any more <br />
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse">
Wondering, headshake <br />
Tired eyes are the death of me <br />
Mouthful of toothpaste before I got to know you <br />
I've got your face hung up high in the gallery <br />
I love this shade, sunflower, sunflower <br />
Your flowers just died, plant new seeds in the melody <br />
Let me inside, I wanna get to know you <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I don't wanna make you feel bad <br />
But I've been trying hard not to act a fool <br />
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I couldn't want you any more <br />
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor <br />
I couldn't want you any more <br />
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight) <br />
I couldn't want you any more <br />
Kids in the kitchen listen to dancehall <br />
I couldn't want you any more <br />
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight) <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody <br />
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you <br />
Sunflowers just died, keep it sweet in your memory <br />
I'm still tongue-tied <br />
Sunflower, sunflower <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Sunflower, sunflower <br />
Sunflower, sunflower <br />
Ayy, woo, ow <br />
Woo-woo, woo-woo <br />
Woo-woo, woo-woo <br />
Woo-woo, woo-woo <br />
Yeah! <br />
Ooh, woo, ooh <br />
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo <br />
