<p className="verse-one">
Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin' <br />
And it sounds just like a song <br />
I want more berries and that summer feelin' <br />
It's so wonderful and warm <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Breathe me in, breathe me out <br />
I don't know if I could ever go without <br />
I'm just thinking out loud <br />
I don't know if I could ever go without <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Strawberries on a summer evenin' <br />
Baby, you're the end of June <br />
I want your belly and that summer feelin' <br />
Getting washed away in you <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Breathe me in, breathe me out <br />
I don't know if I could ever go without <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin' <br />
And it sounds just like a song <br />
I want your belly and that summer feelin' <br />
I don't know if I could ever go without <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar) <br />
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar) <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Eh-eh-eh) <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Ooh, yeah) <br />
Watermelon sugar high <br />
Watermelon sugar <br />

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
It doesn’t really matter what it’s about. “Watermelon Sugar” is about the sweetness of life. It’s also about the female orgasm. But that’s totally different. It’s not really relevant.
<br />
<b>- Harry Styles</b>

Well the hardest song to finish was “Watermelon Sugar.” We wrote it in a day and then it took about a year to finish…Which was very frustrating but uh, happy with it now.
