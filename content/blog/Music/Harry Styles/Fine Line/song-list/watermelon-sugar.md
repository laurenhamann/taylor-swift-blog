<p className="verse-one">
Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
I don't know if I could ever go without
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
</p>
<p className="outro">
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Eh-eh-eh)
Watermelon sugar high
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Ooh, yeah)
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
It doesn’t really matter what it’s about. “Watermelon Sugar” is about the sweetness of life. It’s also about the female orgasm. But that’s totally different. It’s not really relevant.
- Harry Styles

Well the hardest song to finish was “Watermelon Sugar.” We wrote it in a day and then it took about a year to finish…Which was very frustrating but uh, happy with it now.
