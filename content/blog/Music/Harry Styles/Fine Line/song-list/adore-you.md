<p className="verse-one">
Walk in your rainbow paradise (Paradise) <br />
Strawberry lipstick state of mind (State of mind) <br />
I get so lost inside your eyes <br />
Would you believe it? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You don't have to say you love me <br />
You don't have to say nothing <br />
You don't have to say you're mine <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Honey (Ah-ah-ah) <br />
I'd walk through fire for you <br />
Just let me adore you <br />
Oh, honey (Ah-ah-ah) <br />
I'd walk through fire for you <br />
Just let me adore you <br />
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do <br />
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You're wonder under summer sky (Summer sky) <br />
Brown skin and lemon over ice <br />
Would you believe it? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You don't have to say you love me <br />
I just wanna tell you somethin' <br />
Lately, you've been on my mind <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Honey (Ah-ah-ah) <br />
I'd walk through fire for you <br />
Just let me adore you <br />
Oh, honey (Ah-ah-ah) <br />
I'd walk through fire for you <br />
Just let me adore you <br />
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do <br />
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do <br />

[Amy Allen]
It's the only thing I'll ever do<br />
It's the only thing I'll ever do<br />
It's the only thing I'll ever do<br />
It's the only thing I'll ever do<br />
It's the only thing I'll ever do<br />
It's the only thing I'll ever do<br />
It's the only thing I'll ever do<br />
It's the only thing I'll ever do<br />

I'd walk through fire for you <br />
Just let me adore you <br />
Oh, honey (Ah-ah-ah) <br />
I'd walk through fire for you <br />
Just let me adore you <br />
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do (Ah-ah-ah) <br />
(It's the only thing I'll ever do, it's the only thing I'll ever do) <br />
I'd walk through fire for you (It's the only thing I'll ever do) <br />
Just let me adore you <br />
Oh, honey (Ah-ah-ah), oh, honey<br />
(It's the only thing I'll ever do, it's the only thing I'll ever do)<br />
I'd walk through fire for you (It's the only thing I'll ever do) <br />
Just let me adore you (It's the only thing I'll ever do) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Ooh, ooh <br />
Oh, honey <br />
Ooh, ooh <br />
Just let me adore you <br />
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do <br />

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
It’s about that initial infatuation stage when you get that heavy feeling of just bliss, like a blissful, very joyous connection with someone. <br />
We wrote this in a day, we just had so much fun making it. <br />
They’re usually the ones that end up kind of working the best, the ones where everyone’s having fun making it […] they kind of just write themselves. <br />
It was definitely a good experience, making this song, very excited to have it out.

<b>- Harry Styles</b>

‘Adore You’ is the poppiest song on the album. <br />
This time I really felt so much less afraid to write fun pop songs. <br />
It had to do with the whole thing of being on tour and feeling accepted. I listen to stuff like Harry Nilsson and Paul Simon and Van Morrison, and I think, well, Van Morrison has ‘Brown Eyed Girl’ and Nilsson has ‘Coconut.’ <br />Bowie has ‘Let’s Dance.’ The fun stuff is important.
