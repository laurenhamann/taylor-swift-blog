<p className="verse-one">
Don't blame me for falling
I was just a little boy
Don’t blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You can't blame me, darling
Not even a little bit, I was away
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I just hope you see me in a little better light
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape of your lips
You’ll win, it's just a trick
And this is it, so I’m sorry
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it’s hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-secrets-of-fine-line-926657/">
The song is just really like articulation of Mitch’s brain. Even when Mitch plays to himself, he’s got the swing.
