<p className="verse-one">
Don't blame me for falling <br />
I was just a little boy <br />
Don’t blame the drunk caller <br />
Wasn't ready for it all <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You can't blame me, darling <br />
Not even a little bit, I was away <br />
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch <br />
Who can't admit when he's sorry <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons <br />
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it <br />
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home <br />
Be so lonely <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I just hope you see me in a little better light <br />
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind? <br />
’Cause I miss the shape of your lips <br />
You’ll win, it's just a trick <br />
And this is it, so I’m sorry <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons <br />
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it <br />
Don't call me "baby" again, it’s hard for me to go home <br />
Be so lonely <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
To be so lonely, to be so <br />
To be so lonely <br />
To be so lonely, to be so <br />
To be so lonely <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch <br />
Who can't admit when he's sorry <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons <br />
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it <br />
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home <br />
Be so lonely <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
To be so lonely, to be so <br />
To be so lonely <br />
To be so lonely, to be so <br />
To be so lonely <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-secrets-of-fine-line-926657/">
The song is just really like articulation of Mitch’s brain. Even when Mitch plays to himself, he’s got the swing.
