<p className="intro">
[Lucius]
Maybe we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
I've got a good feeling
I'm just takin' it all in
Floating up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the deep end
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And if we're here long enough
They'll sing a song for us (Ooh)
And we'll belong
</p>
<p className="chorus">
[Lucius]
Maybe we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
Given second chances
I don't need all the answers
Feeling good in my skin
I just keep on dancin'
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And if we're here long enough
They'll sing a song for us (Ooh)
And we'll belong
</p>
<p className="chorus">
[Lucius]
Maybe we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And it's just another day (And it's just another day)
And if our friends all pass away (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay)
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay, yeah)
Hey
Here we go now
</p>
<p className="chorus">
[Lucius]
Maybe we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
</p>
<p className="outro">
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto all of the time
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto all of the time
Maybe we can (All together now, one more time)
Find a place to feel good (Oh yeah)
And we can treat people with kindness (Just a little bit of kindness)
Find a place to feel good (Ow)
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-secrets-of-fine-line-926657/">
I told Jeff, I would love to someday write a song called ‘Treat People With Kindness.’ And he was like, ‘Why don’t you just do it?’ It made me uncomfortable at first, because I wasn’t sure what it was—but then I wanted to lean into that. I feel like that song opened something that’s been in my core.
- Harry Styles
