<p className="intro">
[Lucius] <br />
Maybe we can <br />
Find a place to feel good <br />
And we can treat people with kindness <br />
Find a place to feel good <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
I've got a good feeling <br />
I'm just takin' it all in <br />
Floating up and dreamin' <br />
Droppin' into the deep end <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And if we're here long enough <br />
They'll sing a song for us (Ooh) <br />
And we'll belong <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
[Lucius] <br />
Maybe we can <br />
Find a place to feel good <br />
And we can treat people with kindness <br />
Find a place to feel good <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
Given second chances <br />
I don't need all the answers <br />
Feeling good in my skin <br />
I just keep on dancin' <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And if we're here long enough <br />
They'll sing a song for us (Ooh) <br />
And we'll belong <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
[Lucius] <br />
Maybe we can <br />
Find a place to feel good <br />
And we can treat people with kindness <br />
Find a place to feel good <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And it's just another day (And it's just another day) <br />
And if our friends all pass away (Oh-oh, oh-oh) <br />
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay) <br />
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay, yeah) <br />
Hey <br />
Here we go now <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
[Lucius] <br />
Maybe we can <br />
Find a place to feel good <br />
And we can treat people with kindness <br />
Find a place to feel good <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
All we ever want is automatic all the time <br />
All we ever want is auto all of the time <br />
All we ever want is automatic all the time <br />
All we ever want is auto all of the time <br />
Maybe we can (All together now, one more time) <br />
Find a place to feel good (Oh yeah) <br />
And we can treat people with kindness (Just a little bit of kindness) <br />
Find a place to feel good (Ow) <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-secrets-of-fine-line-926657/">
I told Jeff, I would love to someday write a song called ‘Treat People With Kindness.’ And he was like, ‘Why don’t you just do it?’ It made me uncomfortable at first, because I wasn’t sure what it was—but then I wanted to lean into that. I feel like that song opened something that’s been in my core. <br />
