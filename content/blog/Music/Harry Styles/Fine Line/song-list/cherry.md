<p className="intro">
[Camille Rowe]
Coucou <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't you call him "baby" <br />
We're not talking lately <br />
Don't you call him what you used to call me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
I, I confess I can tell that you are at your best <br />
I'm selfish so I'm hating it <br />
I noticed that there's a piece of you in how I dress <br />
Take it as a compliment <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't you call him "baby" <br />
We're not talking lately <br />
Don't you call him what you used to call me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I, I just miss <br />
I just miss your accent and your friends <br />
Did you know I still talk to them? <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't you call him "baby" <br />
We're not talking lately <br />
Don't you call him what you used to call me <br />
Don't you call him "baby" (Coucou) <br />
We're not talking lately <br />
Don't you call him what you used to call me (Coucou) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
[Camille Rowe] <br />
Coucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, j'suis désolée... <br />
Bah non... Nan, c'est pas important... <br />
Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on— <br />
Parfait ! Allez ! <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/6SmM04jO1eQ">
I mean, for me, I think, the song is about, like, you know, freedom and, I guess, self-reflection, self-discovery … I guess a couple things that I’d kind of thought about and, I guess, wrestled with a little bit of the last couple of years and then, I think, the song’s kind of about me just accepting those things.

I wanted to be true to [the breakup]. I wanted it to be true to how I was feeling then, in that moment. It was all part of being more open and not like, ‘I don’t care.’ You get petty when something’s not going the way that you want, and ‘Cherry' is pathetic in a way. The night that I wrote it, everyone had left the studio, it was me, Tyler and Sammy, who is our engineer. I was feeling a lot of pressure because the last record wasn’t a radio record. I felt a lot of pressure to be making these big songs. You know, I have all these ideas about records that I want to make, and ‘I wanna make this record in 5 years, and I wanna make this record in 10 years’… and Tyler just said to me, ‘You just have to make the record that you wanna make right now, that’s it.’ So then we stayed up and wrote “Cherry” that night. <br />
