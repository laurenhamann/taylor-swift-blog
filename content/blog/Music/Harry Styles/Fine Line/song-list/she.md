<p className="verse-one">
Nine in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you, like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to do
</p>

<p className="chorus">
She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She, she)
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
He takes a boat out, imagines just sailing away (Away, away)
And not telling his mates (Not telling his mates)
He wouldn't know what to say (Wouldn't know what to say, to say)
</p>
<p className="chorus">
She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She)
She (She), she's the first one that I see (She)
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is (She, she)
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Lives for the memory
A woman who's just in his head (Just in his head)
And she sleeps in his bed (His bed)
While he plays pretend (Pretend)
So pretend (Pretend)
</p>
<p className="chorus">
She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She, she)
She (She), she's the first one that I see (She)
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is (She, she)
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-secrets-of-fine-line-926657/">
Mitch played that guitar when he was a little, ah, influenced. Well, he was on mushrooms, we all were. We had no idea what we were doing. We forgot all about that track, then went back later and loved it. But Mitch had no idea what he did on guitar that night, so he had to learn it all over from the track. That one to me feels really British. I usually sing with a slight American twang, because the first person I ever listened to was Elvis Presley. When I’ve been doing the track listing, and ticking off the ones to definitely make the album, it’s always in the first three to be ticked. That’s a phenomenal song.
