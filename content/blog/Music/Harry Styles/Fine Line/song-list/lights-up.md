What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back down
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay
Wouldn't put it like that
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming around
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are? (Oh)
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever (Ooh)
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never going back now
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da (Oh)
La-da-da-da-da (Oh)
La-da-da-da-da (Oh)
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/6SmM04jO1eQ">
I mean, for me, I think, the song is about, like, you know, freedom and, I guess, self-reflection, self-discovery … I guess a couple things that I’d kind of thought about and, I guess, wrestled with a little bit of the last couple of years and then, I think, the song’s kind of about me just accepting those things.

- Harry Styles

“Lights Up" was the most unorthodox, probably the most unorthodox song I’ve ever made, um, from how it was written, to how it was recorded. I think my favourite part about “Lights Up” is I don’t really know what it is, I don’t know like what the song is, you know, when I hear it now or it comes on the radio or something I’m kind of like “…okay,” you know like it doesn’t, it doesn’t necessarily make that much sense to me. But I think realizing that it doesn’t anyway have to make sense is the part of it that makes me like it, I guess. - Harry Styles
