What do you mean? <br />
I'm sorry by the way <br />
Never coming back down <br />
Can't you see? <br />
I could, but wouldn't stay <br />
Wouldn't put it like that <br />
What do you mean? <br />
I'm sorry by the way <br />
Never coming around <br />
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same <br />
La-da-da-da-da <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All the lights couldn't put out the dark <br />
Runnin' through my heart <br />
Lights up and they know who you are <br />
Know who you are <br />
Do you know who you are? (Oh) <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Shine, step into the light <br />
Shine, so bright sometimes <br />
Shine, I'm not ever going back <br />
Shine, step into the light <br />
Shine, so bright sometimes <br />
Shine, I'm not ever going back <br />
Shine, step into the light <br />
Shine, so bright sometimes <br />
Shine, I'm not ever (Ooh) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
What do you mean? <br />
I'm sorry by the way <br />
Never going back now <br />
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same <br />
La-da-da-da-da <br />
La-da-da-da-da <br />
La-da-da-da-da (Oh) <br />
La-da-da-da-da (Oh) <br />
La-da-da-da-da (Oh) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All the lights couldn't put out the dark <br />
Runnin' through my heart <br />
Lights up and they know who you are <br />
Know who you are <br />
Do you know who you are? <br />

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/6SmM04jO1eQ">
I mean, for me, I think, the song is about, like, you know, freedom and, I guess, self-reflection, self-discovery … I guess a couple things that I’d kind of thought about and, I guess, wrestled with a little bit of the last couple of years and then, I think, the song’s kind of about me just accepting those things.

“Lights Up" was the most unorthodox, probably the most unorthodox song I’ve ever made, um, from how it was written, to how it was recorded. I think my favourite part about “Lights Up” is I don’t really know what it is, I don’t know like what the song is, you know, when I hear it now or it comes on the radio or something I’m kind of like “…okay,” you know like it doesn’t, it doesn’t necessarily make that much sense to me. But I think realizing that it doesn’t anyway have to make sense is the part of it that makes me like it, I guess.
