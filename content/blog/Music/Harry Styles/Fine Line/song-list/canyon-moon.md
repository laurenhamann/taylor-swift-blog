<p className="verse-one">
Gotta see it to believe it, sky never looked so blue<br />
So hard to leave it, that's what I always do <br />
So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue <br />
I heard Jenny saying, "Go get the kids from school"<br />
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon <br />
</p>

<p className="refrain">
I'll be gone too long from you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-3">
Staring at the ceiling, two weeks and I'll be home <br />
Carry the feeling, through Paris, all through Rome <br />
And I'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm going, oh, I'm going <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going home <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going home <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-four">
Quick pause in conversation, she plays songs I've never heard <br />
An old lover's hippie music, pretends not to know the words <br />
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
I'll be gone too long from you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm going, oh, I'm going <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going home <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home) <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home) <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going home (Yeah) <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home) <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home) <br />
I'm going, oh, I'm going home (Hey) <br />
