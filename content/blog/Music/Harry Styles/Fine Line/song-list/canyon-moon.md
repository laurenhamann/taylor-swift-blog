<p className="verse-one">
Gotta see it to believe it, sky never looked so blue
So hard to leave it, that's what I always do
So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue
I heard Jenny saying, "Go get the kids from school"
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
</p>

<p className="refrain">
I'll be gone too long from you
</p>
<p className="verse-3">
Staring at the ceiling, two weeks and I'll be home
Carry the feeling, through Paris, all through Rome
And I'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
</p>
<p className="verse-four">
Quick pause in conversation, she plays songs I've never heard
An old lover's hippie music, pretends not to know the words
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
</p>
<p className="refrain">
I'll be gone too long from you
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going home (Yeah)
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going home (Hey)
