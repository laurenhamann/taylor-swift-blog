<p className="verse-one">
Little freak, Jezebel <br />
You sit high atop the kitchen counter <br />
Stay green a little while <br />
You bring blue lights to dreams <br />
Starry haze, crystal ball <br />
Somehow, you've become some paranoia <br />
A wet dream just dangling <br />
But your gift is wasted on me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I was thinkin' about who you are <br />
Your delicate point of view <br />
I was thinkin' about you <br />
I'm not worried about where you are <br />
Or who you will go home to <br />
I'm just thinkin' about you <br />
Just thinkin' about you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Did you dress up for Halloween? <br />
I spilled beer on your friend, I'm not sorry <br />
A golf swing and a trampoline <br />
Maybe we'll do this again <br />
Tracksuit and a ponytail <br />
You hide the body all that yoga gave you <br />
Red wine and a ginger ale <br />
But you would make fun of me, for sure <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I was thinkin' about who you are <br />
Your delicate point of view <br />
I was thinkin' about you <br />
I'm not worried about where you are <br />
Or who you will go home to <br />
I'm just thinkin' about you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
I disrespected you <br />
Jumped in feet first and I landed too hard <br />
A broken ankle, karma rules <br />
You never saw my birthmark <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I was thinkin' about who you are <br />
Your delicate point of view <br />
I was thinkin' about you <br />
I'm not worried about where you are <br />
Or who you will go home to <br />
I'm just thinkin' about you <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Just thinkin' about you<br />
Just thinkin' about you<br />
</p>
