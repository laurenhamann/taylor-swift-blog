<p className="verse-one">
Black-and-white film camera <br />
Yellow sunglasses <br />
Ash tray, swimming pool <br />
Hot wax, jump off the roof <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
A small concern with how the engine sounds <br />
We held darkness in withheld clouds <br />
I would ask, "Should we just keep driving?" <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Maple syrup, coffee <br />
Pancakes for two <br />
Hash brown, egg yolk <br />
I will always love you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
A small concern with how the engine sounds <br />
We held darkness in withheld clouds <br />
I would ask, "Should we just keep driving?" <br />
"Should we just keep driving?" <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Passports in foot wells <br />
Kiss her and don't tells <br />
Wine glass, puff pass <br />
Tea with cyborgs <br />
Riot America <br />
Science and edibles <br />
Life hacks going viral in the bathroom <br />
Cocaine, side boob <br />
Choke her with a sea view <br />
Toothache, bad move <br />
Just act normal <br />
Moka pot Monday <br />
It's all good <br />
Hey, you <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Should we just keep driving? <br />
Should we just keep driving? <br />
(Ooh) Should we just keep driving? <br />
</p>
