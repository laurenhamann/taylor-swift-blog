<p className="verse-one">
Black-and-white film camera
Yellow sunglasses
Ash tray, swimming pool
Hot wax, jump off the roof
</p>
<p className="chorus">
A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask, "Should we just keep driving?"
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Maple syrup, coffee
Pancakes for two
Hash brown, egg yolk
I will always love you
</p>
<p className="chorus">
A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask, "Should we just keep driving?"
"Should we just keep driving?"
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Passports in foot wells
Kiss her and don't tells
Wine glass, puff pass
Tea with cyborgs
Riot America
Science and edibles
Life hacks going viral in the bathroom
Cocaine, side boob
Choke her with a sea view
Toothache, bad move
Just act normal
Moka pot Monday
It's all good
Hey, you
</p>
<p className="outro">
Should we just keep driving?
Should we just keep driving?
(Ooh) Should we just keep driving?
</p>
