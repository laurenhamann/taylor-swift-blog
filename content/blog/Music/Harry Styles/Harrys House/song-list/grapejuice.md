<p className="intro">
One, two, three <br />
One, two— <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Yesterday, it finally came, a sunny afternoon <br />
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you <br />
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath <br />
There's never been someone who's so perfect for me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But I got over it and I said <br />
"Give me something old and red" <br />
I pay for it more than I did back then <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
There's just no getting through <br />
Without you <br />
A bottle of rouge <br />
Just me and you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Sittin' in the garden, I'm a couple glasses in <br />
I was tryna count up all the places we'vе been <br />
You're always there, so don't ovеrthink <br />
I'm so over whites and pinks <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I pay for it more than I did back then <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
There's just no getting through <br />
Without you <br />
A bottle of rouge <br />
Just me and you <br />
1982 <br />
Just me and you <br />
There's just no getting through <br />
The grape juice blues <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
One, two, three <br />
One, two, three <br />
One, two, three <br />
One— <br />
</p>
