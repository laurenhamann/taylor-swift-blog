<p className="intro">
One, two, three
One, two—
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Yesterday, it finally came, a sunny afternoon
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
There's never been someone who's so perfect for me
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But I got over it and I said
"Give me something old and red"
I pay for it more than I did back then
</p>
<p className="chorus">
There's just no getting through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Sittin' in the garden, I'm a couple glasses in
I was tryna count up all the places we'vе been
You're always there, so don't ovеrthink
I'm so over whites and pinks
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I pay for it more than I did back then
</p>
<p className="chorus">
There's just no getting through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you
1982
Just me and you
There's just no getting through
The grape juice blues
</p>
<p className="outro">
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
One—
</p>
