<p className="verse-one">
You got a new life <br />
Am I bothering you? Do you wanna talk? <br />
We share the last line <br />
Then we drink the wall till we wanna talk <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I go 'round and 'round <br />
Satellite <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in <br />
I can see you're lonely down there <br />
Don't you know that I am right here? <br />
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in <br />
I can see you're lonely down there <br />
Don't you know that I am right here? <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I'm in an L.A. mood <br />
I don't wanna talk to you <br />
She said, "Give me a day or two" <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I go 'round and 'round <br />
Satellite <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in <br />
I can see you're lonely down there <br />
Don't you know that I am right here? <br />
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in <br />
I can see you're lonely down there <br />
Don't you know that I am right here? <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Right here, right here <br />
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya <br />
I'm here, right here <br />
Wishin' I could be there for ya <br />
Be there for ya <br />
Be there for ya, for ya <br />
For ya <br />
Be there for ya <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in  <br />(Spinnin' out, waitin') <br />
I can see you're lonely down there <br />
Don't you know that I am right here? (Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya) <br />
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in (For ya, for ya, for ya) <br />
I can see you're lonely down there <br />
Don't you know that I am right here? <br />
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in (For ya, for ya, for ya) <br />
I can see you're lonely down there (Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya) <br />
Don't you know that I am right here? <br />
