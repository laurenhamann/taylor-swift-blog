<p className="verse-one">
I'm on the roof
You're in your airplane seat
I was nose-bleedin'
Looking for life out there
Readin' your horoscope
You were just doing cocaine in my kitchen
You never listen
I hope you're missing me by now
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (Ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh)
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Out of New York
I'm on the comedown speed
We're on bicycles
Saying, "There's life out therе"
You've got the antidote
I'll takе one to go, go, please
Get the picture, cut out my middle
You ain't got time for me right now
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (Ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (Ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh)
</p>
<p className="outro">
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://music.apple.com/us/album/harrys-house/1615584999">
We were like, ‘We have to find a way to stay awake and finish this, because if we all go to bed, then this won’t turn out the way it would if we finished tonight.’ So we powered through, finished it and went down to the beach as the sun was coming up and it was like, ‘Okay. Yeah.’ It felt correct that we’d finished it in that place. Life, and songs in particular, are so much about moments. In surfing, for example, sometimes you don’t get the wave and sometimes the wave comes and you haven’t practised. But every now and again, the wave comes and you’re ready, you’ve practised enough that you can ride it. Sometimes when the songs write themselves like that, it feels like, ‘Okay, there’s a reason why sometimes I sit out there, falling off the board a bunch. It’s for this moment.
- Harry Styles
