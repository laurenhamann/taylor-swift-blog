<p className="verse-one">
I'm on the roof <br />
You're in your airplane seat <br />
I was nose-bleedin' <br />
Looking for life out there <br />
Readin' your horoscope <br />
You were just doing cocaine in my kitchen <br />
You never listen <br />
I hope you're missing me by now <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you <br />
You'd be the spoon <br />
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh) <br />
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh) <br />
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (Ooh) <br />
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Out of New York <br />
I'm on the comedown speed <br />
We're on bicycles <br />
Saying, "There's life out therе" <br />
You've got the antidote <br />
I'll takе one to go, go, please <br />
Get the picture, cut out my middle <br />
You ain't got time for me right now <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you <br />
You'd be the spoon <br />
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you <br />
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (Ooh) <br />
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh) <br />
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh) <br />
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh) <br />
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (Ooh) <br />
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you <br />
You'd be the spoon <br />
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you <br />

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://music.apple.com/us/album/harrys-house/1615584999">
We were like, ‘We have to find a way to stay awake and finish this, because if we all go to bed, then this won’t turn out the way it would if we finished tonight.’<br />
So we powered through, finished it and went down to the beach as the sun was coming up and it was like, ‘Okay. Yeah.’<br />
It felt correct that we’d finished it in that place. Life, and songs in particular, are so much about moments. <br />
In surfing, for example, sometimes you don’t get the wave and sometimes the wave comes and you haven’t practised. <br />
But every now and again, the wave comes and you’re ready, you’ve practised enough that you can ride it. <br />
Sometimes when the songs write themselves like that, it feels like, ‘Okay, there’s a reason why sometimes I sit out there, falling off the board a bunch. It’s for this moment.
