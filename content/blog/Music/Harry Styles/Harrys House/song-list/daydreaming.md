<p className="intro">
Ooh-ooh <br />
Ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Livin' in a daydream <br />
She said, "Love me like you paid me" <br />
You know I’ll be gone for so long <br />
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Ooh-ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Stay until the morning <br />
'Cause, baby, lovin' you’s the real thing <br />
It just feels right <br />
When you give me all of your love, give me something to dream about <br />
(All of your love, give me something to dream about) <br />
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Ooh-ooh <br />
Oh, no <br />
Ah <br />
Ah <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Livin' in a daydream <br />
Livin' in a daydream <br />
Livin' in a daydream <br />
Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Livin' in a daydream <br />
Livin' in a daydream (It's alright) <br />
Livin' in a daydream <br />
(Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about) <br />
Give me all of your love <br />
Ooh-ooh (Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about) <br />
Woo (It’s alright) <br />
Woo (Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about) <br />
</p>
