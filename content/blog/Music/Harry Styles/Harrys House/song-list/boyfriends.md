<p className="intro">
Hoo <br />
Niaga ti ta kcab er'uoy, loof <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Boyfriends, they think you're so easy <br />
They take you for granted <br />
They don't know, they're just misunderstanding <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
You <br />
You, you're back at it again <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Weakened when you get deep in <br />
He starts secretly drinking <br />
It gets hard to know what he's thinking <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
You <br />
Love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin <br />
You <br />
You, you still open the door <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You're no closer to him <br />
Now you're halfway home <br />
Only callin' you when <br />
He don't wanna be alone <br />
Oh, and you go <br />
But why? You don't know <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Boyfriends, are they just pretending? <br />
They don't tеll you where it's heading <br />
And you know thе game's never ending <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
You <br />
You lay with him as you stay in the daydream <br />
You <br />
Feel a fool, you're back at it again <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Ooh <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L4m5ZMzf3A">
“Boyfriends” was written right at the end of Fine Line.<br />
I finished the album and we touched on a last time, there was like an extra week growing to write some stuff […] <br />
we were recording “Lights Up” […] and at the end of that session everyone left, and I started writing “Boyfriends” and it almost felt like “Ok, there’s a version where we get this ready to put on [Fine Line]”, and I think there was something about that just felt like “It’s just gonna have its time, so like, let’s not rush to get it done.”<br />
And we did so many versions of it, you know, it was as like, vocal and acoustic, and then vocal and this with that, you know, electric guitar and then this and then that. <br />
[…] We did the harmonies on everything […] and in the end it was like “Ok, we need, like, there’s something that it has to be, to be what it should be” and Ben Harper played on it, it’s his hands playing that guitar. <br />
And it’s like the guitar where he wrote his first three albums. And he’d gifted it to his daughter, and had to ask for it back to borrow to play it on the [song], but he didn’t tell her what it was for, so I believe now will be her finding out where he played it. <br />
But thank you for letting us borrow it. It was just like a singular moment I think for all us, we’re such big fan of him as well and it just fell like a really special moment. […] I think the good part of [“Boyfriends”] is that it is everything. <br />
It’s both acknowledging my own behavior. It’s looking at behavior that I’ve witnessed. I grew up with a sister, so it’s watching her date people and watching friends date people, and people don’t treat each other very nicely sometimes. <br />
It was one of those really quick, just say what you think of boyfriends.
