<p className="verse-one">
You were riding your bike to the sound of "It's No Big Deal" <br />
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels <br />
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now <br />
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You can let it go <br />
You can throw a party full of everyone you know <br />
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love <br />
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Matilda, you talk of the pain like it's all alright <br />
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе <br />
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days <br />
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You can let it go <br />
You can throw a party full of everyone you know <br />
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love <br />
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up <br />
You can see the world, following the seasons <br />
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason <br />
'Cause they never showed you love <br />
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You're just in time, make your tea and your toast <br />
You framed all your posters and dyed your clothes, ooh <br />
You don't have to go <br />
You don't have to go home <br />
Oh, there's a long way to go <br />
I don't believe that time will change your mind <br />
In other words, I know they won't hurt you anymore <br />
As long as you can let them go <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You can let it go <br />
You can throw a party full of everyone you know <br />
You can start a family who will always show you love <br />
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own <br />
You can let it go <br />
You can throw a party full of everyone you know <br />
You can start a family who will always show you love <br />
You don't have to be sorry, no <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://music.apple.com/us/album/harrys-house/1615584999">
I had an experience with someone where, in getting to know them better, they revealed some stuff to me that was very much like, ‘Oh, that’s not normal, like I think you should maybe get some help or something.’ <br />
This song was inspired by that experience and person, who I kind of disguised as Matilda from the Roald Dahl book. <br />
I played it to a couple of friends and all of them cried. So I was like, ‘Okay, I think this is something to pay attention to.’ It’s a weird one, because with something like this, it’s like, ‘I want to give you something, I want to support you in some way, but it’s not necessarily my place to make it about me because it’s not my experience.’<br />
Sometimes it’s just about listening. I hope that’s what I did here. <br />
If nothing else, it just says, ‘I was listening to you.’

I think “Matilda” is kind of self-explanatory […] <br />
I like that it was this personal story to me about someone else, being able to say, “This thing is more important than me just making music about myself, because I think it could mean more to you and a lot more people” […] I played it for a couple of friends, and all of them cried. I was, like, “Okay, this is something to pay attention to.”<br />
But I haven’t played it to the person who it’s about, and they don’t know it’s about them.
