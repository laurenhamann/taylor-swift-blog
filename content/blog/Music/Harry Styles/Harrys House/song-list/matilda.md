<p className="verse-one">
You were riding your bike to the sound of "It's No Big Deal"
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Matilda, you talk of the pain like it's all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up
You can see the world, following the seasons
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You're just in time, make your tea and your toast
You framed all your posters and dyed your clothes, ooh
You don't have to go
You don't have to go home
Oh, there's a long way to go
I don't believe that time will change your mind
In other words, I know they won't hurt you anymore
As long as you can let them go
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
You can start a family who will always show you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
You can start a family who will always show you love
You don't have to be sorry, no
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://music.apple.com/us/album/harrys-house/1615584999">
I had an experience with someone where, in getting to know them better, they revealed some stuff to me that was very much like, ‘Oh, that’s not normal, like I think you should maybe get some help or something.’ This song was inspired by that experience and person, who I kind of disguised as Matilda from the Roald Dahl book. I played it to a couple of friends and all of them cried. So I was like, ‘Okay, I think this is something to pay attention to.’ It’s a weird one, because with something like this, it’s like, ‘I want to give you something, I want to support you in some way, but it’s not necessarily my place to make it about me because it’s not my experience.’ Sometimes it’s just about listening. I hope that’s what I did here. If nothing else, it just says, ‘I was listening to you.’

I think “Matilda” is kind of self-explanatory […] I like that it was this personal story to me about someone else, being able to say, “This thing is more important than me just making music about myself, because I think it could mean more to you and a lot more people” […] I played it for a couple of friends, and all of them cried. I was, like, “Okay, this is something to pay attention to.” But I haven’t played it to the person who it’s about, and they don’t know it’s about them.
