<p className="intro">
Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
</p>
<p className="chorus">
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh
</p>
<p className="chorus">
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
</p>
<p className="outro">
(Hey)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0oWm2oqmok">
This was the last song that was written for the album. It was written in my friend’s front room in England’s country side. It started off much slower, as it was being written, it was a lot slower, the kind of piano line was being played on piano and it kind of turned into a synth, and it just kind of took on a new life. But I’m a fan of it, it’s one of my favourite songs on the album, so I hope people are liking it.

“As It Was” is about metamorphosis and perspective change, and the whole thing of, like, when you have that, it’s not something you have time with, and people go, like, “Alright, we’ll give you a couple more days with this moment and you get to say goodbye to your former self,” or whatever it is, and by the time you realize, it’s already gone. I think a big part of kinda evolution of what music you make as well is, like, it doesn’t matter if people want you to be that thing that they always loved about you or they want you to be that person, because you’re not that person anymore. Everyone is changing, and I think there’s no reason to not approach music that way, and kind of let it change and turn out differently than you started. You don’t always get to realize something happens, and you kind of look at it and be, like, “Wow,” and then you get to decide whether that is devastating or brilliant, and accept the fact that it’s probably both.
