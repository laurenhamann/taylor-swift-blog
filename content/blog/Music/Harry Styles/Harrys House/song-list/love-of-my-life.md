<p className="intro">
Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Take a walk on Sunday through the afternoon
We can always find somethin' for us to do
We don't really like what's on the news, but it's on all the time
I take you with me every time I go away
In a hotel, usin' someone else's name
I remember back at Jonny's place, it's not the same anymore
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
It's not what I wantеd, to leave you behind
Don't know whеre you'll land when you fly
But, ​baby, you were the love of my life
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
It's unfortunate (Ooh)
Just coordinates (Ooh)
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I don't know you half as well as all my friends
I won't pretend that I've been doin' everything I can
To get to know your creases and your ends
Are they the same?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
​Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
It's not what I wanted, to leave you behind
Don't know where you'll land when you fly
But, ​baby, you were the love of my life
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L4m5ZMzf3A">
“Love of my Life”… I’ve always wanted to write a song about like home and loving England and all that kind of stuff. And it’s always kinda hard to do without being like ‘went to the chippy and I did this thing’”
- Harry Styles

<blockquote>
“Love of My Life” was the most terrifying song because it’s so bare. It’s so sparse. It’s also very much in the spirit of what Harry’s House is about: I wanted to make an acoustic EP, all in my house, and make it really intimate. It’s named after the Japanese pop pioneer [Haruomi] Hosono, who had an album in the ‘70s called Hosono House. I immediately started thinking about what Harry’s House might look like. It took time for me to realise that the house wasn’t a geographical location, it was an internal thing. When I applied that concept to the songs we were making here, everything took on new meaning. Imagine it’s a day in my house or a day in my mind. What do I go through? I’m playing fun music. I’m playing sad music. I’m playing this, I’m playing that. I have doubts. I’m feeling stuff. And it’s all mine. This is my favourite album at the moment. I love it so much. And because of the circumstances, it was made very intimately; everything was played by a small number of people and made in a room. To me, it’s everything. It’s everything I’ve wanted to make.
-Harry Styles
