<p className="verse-one">
Things haven't been quite the same
There's a haze on the horizon, babe
It's only been a couple of days and I miss you, mmm, yeah
When nothing really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I'll do everything I can to help you through
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If you're feeling down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happier, baby
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We've been doin' all this late-night talkin'
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I've never been a fan of change
But I'd follow you to any place
If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate, I'm coming, too
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If you're feeling down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happiеr, baby
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We've been doin' all this late-night talkin'
'Bout anything you want until thе morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (Can't get you off my mind)
I won't even try (I won't even try)
To get you off my mind (Get you off my mind)
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We've been doin' all this late-night talkin'
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Can't get you off my mind (All this late-night talking)
Can't get you off my mind (All this late-night talking)
I won't even try (All this late-night talking)
Can't get you off my— (All this late-night talking)
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CewLOZBDUpX/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">
It was the first song that was written for the album. It was on like day one of moving into the studio, and everything was still getting set up. And I think it kind of set the tone for the intent with which, like, the album was made, you know, if you’re ever kind of stressed about getting fun songs, or whatever. I think when we wrote this one, we felt like it was really good, and then it kind of let us like relax a little bit… like okay, if there’s nothing else, we feel like we did some work so… Yeah, it’s a lot of fun, the song’s a lot of fun and I’ve enjoyed dancing to it many a time.

- Harry Styles
