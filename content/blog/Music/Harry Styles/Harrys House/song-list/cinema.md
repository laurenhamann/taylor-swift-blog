<p className="intro">
You got, you got the cinema <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
It's you <br />
And I'm not gettin' over it <br />
Darling, is it cool <br />
If I'm stubborn when it comes to this? <br />
I guess we're in time <br />
If you're getting yourself wet for me <br />
I guess you're all mine <br />
When you're sleeping in this bed with me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I just think you're cool <br />
I dig your cinema <br />
Do you think I'm cool, too? <br />
Or am I too into you? <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Tell me what you want and you got it, love <br />
I want all of you, gimme all you got <br />
That's cinema <br />
That's cinema, uh-huh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
It's you <br />
Don't know why, but it feels so right to me <br />
Something in the way you move <br />
I like it when you dance for me (I just think it's—) <br />
You all the time (Time, time) <br />
In doses at night (Night, night) <br />
No roof on the drive <br />
Dust off the high <br />
And go to sleep (Go to sleep, go to sleep) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I just think you're cool <br />
I dig your cinema <br />
Do you think I'm cool, too? <br />
Or am I too into you? <br />
I just think you're cool (Co-cool) <br />
I dig your cinema (Cinema) <br />
Do you think I'm cool, too? <br />
Or am I too into you? (Cinema) <br />
Cinema <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You got, you got <br />
I bring the pop, you pop <br />
You got, you got <br />
I bring the pop <br />
You got, you got the cinema <br />
I bring the pop to the cinema, you pop <br />
You got, you got the cinema <br />
You got, you got the cinema <br />
I bring the pop to the cinema <br />
You pop when we get intimate <br />
You got, you got the cinema <br />
You got, you got the cinema (Cinema) <br />
I bring the pop to the cinema <br />
You pop when we get intimate (Baby, you're cinema) <br />
You got, you got the cinema <br />
You got, you got the cinema <br />
I bring the pop to the cinema <br />
You pop when we get intimate (Baby, you're cinema) <br />
You got, you got the cinema <br />
You got, you got the cinema <br />
I bring the pop to the cinema <br />
You pop when we get intimate (Baby, you're cinema) <br />
You got, you got the cinema <br />
You got, you got the cinema (Cinema) <br />
I bring the pop to the cinema <br />
You pop when we get intimate <br />

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote cite="https://music.apple.com/us/album/harrys-house/1615584999">
I think I just wanted to make something that felt really fun, honestly. <br />
I was on a treadmill going, ‘Do-do-do-do-do-do.’ I tend to do so much writing in the studio, but with this one, I did a little bit here and then I went home and added a little bit there, and then kind of left it, and then went into the studio to put it all together. <br />
That was a theme across the whole album, actually: We used to book a studio and be like, ‘Okay, we’ve got it for two months, grind it out.’<br />
But some days you just don’t want to be there, and eventually you’ve been in the studio so long, the only thing you can write about is nothing because you haven’t done anything. <br />
So with this album, we’d work for a couple of weeks and then everyone would go off and live their lives.
