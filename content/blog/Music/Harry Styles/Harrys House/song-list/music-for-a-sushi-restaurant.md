<p className="intro">
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Green eyes, fried rice, I could cook an egg on you
Late night, game time, coffee on the stove, yeah (Oh)
You're sweet ice cream, but you could use a Flake or two
Blue bubblegum twisted 'round your tongue
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I don't want you to get lost
I don't want you to go broke
I want you
</p>
<p className="interlude">
It's 'cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way
Just a little taste
You know I love you, babe
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
(You know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
"Excuse me, a green tea?"
Music for a sushi restaurant
From ice on rice
Scuba-duba-dubub-boo (Oh)
Music for a sushi restaurant
Music for a sushi restaurant
Music for whatever you want
Scuba-duba-dubub-boo (Oh)
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I'm not going to get lost
I'm not going to go broke
Staying cool
(You know I love you, babe)
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
(You know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
</p>
<p className="bridge">
(Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba)
If the stars were edible
And our hearts were never full
(Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba)
Could we live with just a taste?
Just a taste
</p>
<p className="interlude">
Ba, ba-ba (It's 'cause I love you, babe)
(In every kind of way)
Ba-ba (Just a little taste)
(You know I love you, babe)
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
(You know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
After Fine Line, I had an idea of how I thought the next album would open. But there’s something about ‘Sushi’ that felt like, ‘Nah, that’s how I want to start.’ It becomes really obvious what the first song should be based on what you play for people when they’re like, ‘Oh, can I hear a bit of the music?’ It’s like, how do you want to set the tone? - Harry Styles
