<p className="intro">
Ba, ba-ba <br />
Ba-ba, ba-ba <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Green eyes, fried rice, I could cook an egg on you <br />
Late night, game time, coffee on the stove, yeah  (Oh) <br />
You're sweet ice cream, but you could use a Flake or two <br />
Blue bubblegum twisted 'round your tongue <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I don't want you to get lost <br />
I don't want you to go broke <br />
I want you <br />
</p>
<p className="interlude">
It's 'cause I love you, babe <br />
In every kind of way <br />
Just a little taste <br />
You know I love you, babe <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ba, ba-ba <br />
Ba-ba, ba-ba <br />
(You know I love you, babe) <br />
Ba, ba-ba <br />
Ba-ba, ba-ba <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
"Excuse me, a green tea?" <br />
Music for a sushi restaurant <br />
From ice on rice <br />
Scuba-duba-dubub-boo (Oh) <br />
Music for a sushi restaurant <br />
Music for a sushi restaurant <br />
Music for whatever you want <br />
Scuba-duba-dubub-boo (Oh) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I'm not going to get lost <br />
I'm not going to go broke <br />
Staying cool <br />
(You know I love you, babe) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ba, ba-ba <br />
Ba-ba, ba-ba <br />
(You know I love you, babe) <br />
Ba, ba-ba <br />
Ba-ba, ba-ba <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
(Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba) <br />
If the stars were edible <br />
And our hearts were never full <br />
(Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba) <br />
Could we live with just a taste? <br />
Just a taste <br />
</p>
<p className="interlude">
Ba, ba-ba (It's 'cause I love you, babe) <br />
(In every kind of way) <br />
Ba-ba (Just a little taste) <br />
(You know I love you, babe) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ba, ba-ba <br />
Ba-ba, ba-ba <br />
(You know I love you, babe) <br />
Ba, ba-ba <br />
Ba-ba, ba-ba <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
After Fine Line, I had an idea of how I thought the next album would open. <br />
But there’s something about ‘Sushi’ that felt like, ‘Nah, that’s how I want to start.’ <br />
It becomes really obvious what the first song should be based on what you play for people when they’re like, ‘Oh, can I hear a bit of the music?’ <br />
It’s like, how do you want to set the tone? 
<b>- Harry Styles</b>
