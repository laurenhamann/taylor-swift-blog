<p className="verse-one">
Sick of all these people talking,<br /> 
sick of all this noise <br />
Tired of all these cameras flashing, <br />
sick of being poised <br />
Now my neck is open wide, <br />
begging for a fist around it <br />
Already choking on my pride, <br /> 
so there's no use crying about it <br />
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
Agnus dei <br />
Agnus dei <br />
Agnus dei <br />
Agnus dei <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm headed straight for the castle <br />
They wanna make me their queen <br />
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there <br />
saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean <br />
I'm headed straight for the castle <br />
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up <br />
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there  <br /> saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut <br />
Straight for the castle <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Oh, all these minutes passing, <br /> sick of feeling used <br />
If you wanna break these walls down, <br /> you’re gonna get bruised <br />
Now my neck is open wide,  <br /> begging for a fist around it <br />
Already choking on my pride,  <br /> so there's no use crying about it <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Crying about it (Agnus dei) <br />
Crying about it (Agnus dei) <br />
Crying about it, <br /> about it, bout it, bout it (Agnus dei, Agnus dei) <br />

</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm headed straight for the castle <br />
They wanna make me their queen <br />
And there's an old man sitting on the throne saying  <br /> that I probably shouldn't be so mean <br />
I'm headed straight for the castle <br />
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up <br />
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there  <br /> saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut <br />
Straight for the castle <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
There's no use crying about it <br />
There's no use crying about it <br />
There's no use crying about it <br />
There's no use crying about it <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm headed straight for the castle <br />
They wanna make me their queen <br />
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there  <br /> that's saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean <br />
I'm headed straight for the castle <br />
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up <br />
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there  <br /> saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut <br />
Straight for the castle <br />
They wanna make me their queen <br />
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there  <br /> saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean <br />
I'm headed straight for the castle <br />
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up <br />
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there  <br /> saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut <br />
Straight for the castle <br />

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
Castle! <br /> I made it in a pillow fort in a basement with @Lido !  <br /> Hahah.  <br /> I picked a bunch of sounds I liked from some folders and handed them to him like a puzzle and said “make this a song!” <br /> He made the castle beat and I wrote the song/ cut the vocal 20 mins later! <br />
