<p className="intro">
I'm searching for something that I can't reach
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
I don't like them innocent, I don't want no face fresh
Want them wearing leather, begging, let me be your taste test
I like the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white lies
Kiss me in the corridor, but quick to tell me goodbye
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway
</p>
<p className="chorus">
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You're a Rolling Stone boy, never-sleep-alone boy
Got a million numbers and they're filling up your phone, boy
I'm off the deep end, sleeping all night through the weekend
Saying that I love him but I know I'm gonna leave him
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway
</p>
<p className="chorus">
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I'm searching for something that I can't reach
</p>
<p className="chorus">
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?
</p>

## Quotes from the artist

<blockquote>
“Ghost” was one of the first songs I ever wrote in like, an actual studio environment. I wrote it with my friend Dylan Scott, who is a band called Young Rising Sons. I just started The Halsey project, I had no idea what I was doing and I was writing like, acoustic songs before this. We sat down and we started like, messing with sounds and we wanted like these, “church-y, scary, shimmery sounds” – the words I used. Most people when you’re like, “Hey, I want shimmery sounds,” are like, “What?” but he knew right away. So we came up with “Ghost” and it ended up just being like my signature. It was like how I knew what the Halsey project was gonna sound like. It was our single and, you know, SiriusXM started playing it which was awesome. A lot of people give me a lot of weird looks for it because it’s like two minutes and thirty seconds long, it starts with the bridge, doesn’t make any sense, there’s like a rap, white girl part in the beginning in it, but we moved forward with it because we had faith in it, and I’m really glad we did… and it’s the fan favorite. - Halsey
