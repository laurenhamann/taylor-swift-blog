<p className="verse-one">
There's a place way down in Bed Stuy
Where a boy lives behind bricks
He's got an eye for girls of eighteen
And he turns them out like tricks
I went down to a place in Bed Stuy
A little liquor on my lips
I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah-ah, ha ah-ah, ah
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah-ah, ha ah-ah, ah
I'm a hurricane

</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I went down to a place in Brooklyn
Where ya tripped on LSD
And I found myself reminded
To keep you far away from me
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah-ah, ha ah-ah, ah
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah-ah, ha ah-ah, ah
I'm a hurricane
</p>
<p className="bridge">
He says, "Oh, baby, beggin' you to save me
Though lately, I like 'em crazy
Oh, maybe, you could devastate me
Little lady, come and fade me"
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
Come and fade me
Come and fade me
I'm a hurricane
</p>

## Quotes from the artist

<blockquote>
Hurricane, mmm…is like the trippy song, I love this song. When I play this live, I like close my eyes and zone out super hard and kinda like for get that I’m on stage cause it’s so dreamy. It’s about a girl that kinda like falls for this guy who is gonna make things hard on her and is gonna take advantage of her, but she kinda ends up turning it around in the end and she says: “I’m a wanderess/I’m a one night stand/Don’t belong to no city/Don’t belong to no man.” So it’s kinda like her response to him, saying like you know, you can think you got me all you want, but I don’t belong to anyone but me. And umm you know I talk about Brooklyn, Brooklyn’s my place. That’s where Halsey comes from, Hurricane is a very special song to me and I love it. - Halsey
