<p className="verse-one">
Cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles
Just what you’d expect inside her new Balenciaga
Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire
Self-made success, now she rolls with Rockefellers
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
Survival of the richest, the city’s ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we don’t feel like outsiders at all

</p>
<p className="chorus">
We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana (Sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Young James Dean, some say he looks just like his father
But he could never love somebody’s daughter
Football team loved more than just the game
So he vowed to be his husband at the altar
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Survival of the richest, the city’s ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we don’t feel like outsiders at all
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana (Sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana
</p>
<p className="bridge">
We know very well who we are
So we hold it down when summer starts
What kind of dough have you been spending?
What kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana (Sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana
</p>
<p className="outro">
We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana (Sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
There are a lot of kids out there who are like, “These lyrics are so wack. It’s so lame. I bet she wasn’t raised on Biggie and Nirvana.” This is a satire. I sat down to write this song like, “I’m writing a song that’s a social commentary on pop culture. I’m gonna make this as pop culture-y as possible.” And I think that I achieved that because people are tweeting me saying it’s too pop culture-y. That is [also] a cheeky, tongue-in-cheek way of saying my dad’s black and my mom’s white. - Halsey
