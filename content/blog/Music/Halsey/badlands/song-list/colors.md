<p className="verse-one">
Your little brother never tells you  <br /> but he loves you so <br />
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show <br />
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope <br />
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old <br />
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise <br />
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink <br />
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece <br />
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Everything is blue <br />
His pills, his hands, his jeans <br />
And now I'm covered in the colors <br />
Pulled apart at the seams <br />
And it's blue <br />
And it's blue <br />
Everything is gray <br />
His hair, his smoke, his dreams <br />
And now he's so devoid of color <br />
He don't know what it means <br />
And he's blue <br />
And he's blue <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You were a vision in the morning <br /> when the light came through <br />
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you <br />
He said, "You'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too" <br />
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise <br />
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink <br />
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece <br />
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Everything is blue <br />
His pills, his hands, his jeans <br />
And now I'm covered in the colors <br />
Pulled apart at the seams <br />
And it's blue <br />
And it's blue <br />
Everything is gray <br />
His hair, his smoke, his dreams <br />
And now he's so devoid of color <br />
He don't know what it means <br />
And he's blue <br />
And he's blue <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You were red, and you liked me because I was blue <br />
But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky <br />
Then you decided purple just wasn't for you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Everything is blue <br />
His pills, his hands, his jeans <br />
And now I'm covered in the colors <br />
Pulled apart at the seams <br />
And it's blue <br />
And it's blue <br />
Everything is gray <br />
His hair, his smoke, his dreams <br />
And now he's so devoid of color <br />
He don't know what it means <br />
And he's blue <br />
And he's blue <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Everything is blue <br />
Everything is blue <br />
Everything is blue <br />
Everything is blue <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the artist

<blockquote>
My song “Colors” is about  <br /> being in a relationship with someone  <br /> and kind of watching the vibrancy slowly start to leak out of them, <br /> watch the colors start to fade, <br /> whether they’re falling victim to drugs or falling victim to work  <br /> or any sort of negative behavior that’s kind of taking them away from the bright and lively person that they used to be. <br /> You can kind of see them start to fade to gray, and you wish you had them back the way that they used to be. <br /> - Halsey
