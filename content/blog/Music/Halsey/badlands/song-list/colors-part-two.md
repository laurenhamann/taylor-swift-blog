Hmm <br />
Everything is— <br />

<p className="chorus">
Everything is (Blue) <br />
Everything is (Blue) <br />
You're dripping like a saturated sunrise (Sun—, sun—) <br />
Everything is blue (Blue) <br />
I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old <br />
Everything is blue (Blue) <br />
Everything is (Blue) <br />
