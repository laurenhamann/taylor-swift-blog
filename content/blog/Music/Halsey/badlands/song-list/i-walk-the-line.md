<p className="intro">
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
</p>

<p className="chorus">
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Oh, because you're mine, I walk the line

</p>
<p className="outro">
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
</p>
