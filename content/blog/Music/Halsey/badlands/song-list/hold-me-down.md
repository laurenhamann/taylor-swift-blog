<p className="verse-one">
My demons are begging me to open up my mouth
I need them
Mechanically make the words come out
They fight me, vigorous and angry
Watch them pounce
Ignite me
Licking up the flames they bring about
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...

</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Selfish
Taking what I want, and call it mine
I’m helpless
Clinging to a little bit of spine
They rush me
Telling me I’m running out of time
They shush me (Shh)
Walking me across a fragile line
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Hold me down now
Hold me down now
Hold me do-o-o-o-own
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
“I was meeting a bunch of mean, old men who thought they knew better than I. And I met this one guy in particular, a certain asshole who inspired this song. This song is a reminder that no matter how small you are or how small people may make you seem, you should never let anything hold you down.” - Halsey
