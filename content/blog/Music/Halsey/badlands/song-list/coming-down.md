<p className="verse-one">
I found god <br />
I found him in a lover <br />
When his hair falls in his face <br />
And his hands so cold they shake <br />
I found the devil <br />
I found him in a lover <br />
And his lips like tangerines <br />
In his color-coded speak <br />
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
Now we're lost somewhere in outer space <br />
In a hotel room where demons play <br />
They run around beneath our feet <br />
We roll around beneath these sheets <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I've got a lover, a love like religion <br />
I'm such a fool for sacrifice <br />
He's coming down, down, coming down <br />
It's coming down, down, coming down <br />
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven <br />
I'm such a fool to pay this price <br />
It's coming down, down, coming down <br />
It's coming down, down, coming down <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I found a martyr <br />
He told me that I'd never <br />
With his educated eyes <br />
And his head between my thighs
I found a savior
I don't think he remembers
Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
(Down, down, down, down...)
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Every single night pray the sun will rise
Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Every single night pray the sun will rise
Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
</p>
<p className="outro">
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
</p>
