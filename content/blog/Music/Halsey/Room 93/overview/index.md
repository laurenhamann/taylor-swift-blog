## Best Choruses

[All You Had To Do Was Stay](../Song%20List/all-you-had-to-do-was-stay.md)

<p className="chorus">
Stay <br />
Hey, all you had to do was stay <br />
Had me in the palm of your hand <br />
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in? <br />
Hey, now you say you want it back <br />
Now that it's just too late <br />
Well, it could've been easy <br />
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
</p>

[Bad Blood](../Song%20List/bad-blood.md)

<p className="chorus">
'Cause baby now we got bad blood <br />
You know it used to be mad love <br />
So take a look at what you've done <br />
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood <br />
now we got problems <br />
And I don't think we can solve 'em <br />
You made a really deep cut <br />
And baby, now we got bad blood <br />
</p>
