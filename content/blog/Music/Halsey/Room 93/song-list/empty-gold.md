<p className="verse-one">
I, I must confess
How hard I tried to breathe, through the trees of loneliness
You, you must confess
How hard you need to see, through the heart beating out my chest

</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
Feel like we've been falling down
Like these autumn leaves
But baby, don't let winter come
Don't let our hearts freeze
</p>
<p className="chorus">
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Dark as midnight sun
Smoke as black as charcoal fills into our fragile lungs
'Cause when our demons come
Dancing in the shadows to a game that can't be won
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Feel like we've been falling down
Like these autumn leaves
But baby, don't let winter come
Don't let our hearts freeze
</p>
<p className="chorus">
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold

</p>
<p className="bridge">
We're the underdogs, in this world alone
I'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones
We're the alley cats, and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts, they won't take our souls
We're the underdogs, in this world alone
I'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones
We're the alley cats, and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts, they won't take our soul
</p>
<p className="chorus">
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
</p>

<p className="outro">
We will walk away from empty gold
</p>
