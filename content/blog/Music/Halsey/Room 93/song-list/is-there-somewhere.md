<p className="verse-one">
You were dancing in your tube socks in our hotel room
Flashing those eyes like highway signs
Light one up and hand it over, rest your head upon my shoulder
I just wanna feel your lips against my skin
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
White sheets, bright lights, crooked teeth, and the nightlife
You told me this is right where it begins
But your lips hang heavy underneath me
And I promised myself I wouldn’t let you complete me
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
I'm trying not to let it show, that I don't want to let this go
Is there somewhere you can meet me?
'Cause I clutched your arms like stairway railings
And you clutched my brain and eased my ailing
</p>
<p className="verse-four">
You're writing lines about me, romantic poetry
Your girl's got red in her cheeks
'Cause we're something she can't see
And I try to refrain but you're stuck in my brain
All I do is cry and complain, because second's not the same
</p>
<p className="outro">
I'm sorry but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that we're in love?
I'm sorry but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that we're in love?
</p>

## Quotes from the artist

<blockquote>
The first song is “Is There Somewhere” and I actually wrote and recorded this song on Garage Band at first like a couple of months before I signed, um … and I put it up on Youtube and um, it was like the most amateur thing ever. It was like I had put up this video and the end of it had like a little black slide that said, like, insert title here because I had no idea how to use technology.

Basically, “Is There Somewhere” is like a prologue to the EP cause the EP is called “Room 93” and um, it basically just touches on like the human intimacy of hotel rooms and how it’s like an alternate universe and “Is There Somewhere” is like a prologue to that.

It kinda tells the story of a couple in a hotel room, experiencing, like, a tender moment together and the most notable line is “Is there somewhere you can meet me?” because it’s like a frequently exchanged text message between myself and the person this song’s about. It was kinda like, “Is there somewhere you can meet me?” and it usually ended up being a hotel room. So that’s where “Is There Somewhere” came from and I think it’s one of my favorite songs… I’ve ever written. - Halsey
