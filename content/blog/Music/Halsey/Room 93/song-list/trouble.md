<p className="verse-one">
Would you bleed for me?
Lick it off my lips like you needed me?
Would you sit me on a couch with your fingers in my mouth?
You look so cool when you're reading me
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
Let's cause a little trouble
Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But I've got my mind made up this time
'Cause there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head tonight
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Would you lie for me?
Cross your sorry heart and hope to die for me?
Would you pin me to a wall?
Would you beg or would you crawl?
Stick a needle in your hungry eyes for me?
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Let's cause a little trouble
Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek

</p>
<p className="chorus">
But I've got my mind made up this time
'Cause there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head tonight
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Don't forget me, don't forget me
I wouldn't leave you if you'd let me
When you met me, when you met me
You told me you were gonna get me
Don't forget me, don't forget me
I wouldn't leave you if you'd
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I've got my mind made up this time
'Cause there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head tonight, tonight, tonight
</p>

<p className="outro">
Set a fire in my head tonight
</p>
