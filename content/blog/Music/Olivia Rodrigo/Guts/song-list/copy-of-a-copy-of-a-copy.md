<p className="verse-one">
It's an old curse, dreamers divin' head first
Broken beaks and dead birds
Can't get through the glass
There's no use cryin' over spilled blood
Carin' only kills love
A kiss won't bring it back
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I know that the first blow hits you cold
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Young man, hush your crying, dry your tears away
Nothing is original, there's nothing left to say
You won't be the first or be the last to bleed
Every broken heart as far as your eye can see
It's a copy of a copy of a copy
It's a copy of a copy of a copy
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I can hear you, howlin' 'til your lungs hurt
So let this be your comfort
You're not the only one, no
In a strange way, we're all in this together
Been this way forever, you're not the only one
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I know that the first blow hits you cold
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Young man, hush your crying, dry your tears away
Nothing is original, there's nothing left to say
You won't be the first or be the last to bleed
Every broken heart as far as your eye can see
It's a copy of a copy of a copy
It's a copy of a copy of a copy
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Young man, hush your crying, dry your tears away
Nothing is original, there's nothing left to say
You won't be the first or be the last to bleed
Every broken heart as far as your eye can see
It's a copy of a copy of a copy
It's a copy of a copy of a copy
It's a copy of a copy of a copy
It's a copy of a copy of a copy
</p>
