<p className="intro">
You said I'm holdin' on to heartache
You said I wear it like a crown
It's gonna drag me down
I'm holdin' on to heartache
You should be starin' at the sky
The birds just passin' by, love
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
The wind held us up, but
We knew that all would change
Creates the strangest feelin'
Just slowly waitin' for the end
I still have dreams about it
The moments as they came
The moments never shown to us
Because we faded into darkness
</p>
<p className="refrain">
I can still hear a silence
I can still hear a clock that's tickin'
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You said I'm holdin' on to heartache
You said I wear it like a crown
It's gonna drag me down
I'm holdin' on to heartache
You should be starin' at the sky
The birds just passin' by, love
Holdin' on to heartache
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
The nights, they change in seasons
Become the strangest days
I called you twice, but then regretted it
And changed my number
The questions that I'd ask you
"Where did it all go wrong?"
There's endless versions of the thing
That keeps me driftin' back to darkness
</p>
<p className="refrain">
I can still hear your silence
I can still hear a clock that's tickin'
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You said I'm holdin' on to heartache
You said I wear it like a crown
It's gonna drag me down
I'm holdin' on to heartache
You should be starin' at the sky
The birds just passin' by, love
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You know the party's over
When you're standin' in an empty space alone
And time can always heal you
If you let it make its way into your bones
Nothing's ever easy
To be honest, I'm not easy on myself
The second that I see you
The space between us just comes floodin' back
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You said I'm holdin' on to heartache
You said I wear it like a crown
It's gonna drag me down
I'm holdin' on to heartache
You should be starin' at the sky
The birds just passin' by, love
</p>
