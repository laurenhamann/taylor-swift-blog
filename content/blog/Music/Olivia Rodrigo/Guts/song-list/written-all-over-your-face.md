<p className="intro">
Hey, babe
It's written all over your face, say it
A hurricane behind the door
So I've come ready for a war
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
When you don't want coffee in the morning
I know I'm in a hole
It's hard enough to get you sober
Got no chance if I'm hungover
I ain't even woken up yet
Not nearly vertical
All I know is I'm in trouble
'Cause the atmosphere's so cold, so
 
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hey, babe
It's written all over your face, say it
A hurricane behind the door
So I've come ready for a war
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
When I hеar that thunder in the distance
I know it's gеtting close
You're giving me that silent treatment
Don't know what it's achieving
When we're finished saying nothing
Can we please get back to loving?
When it's good, it's really something
Can we please get back to us now? 
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hey, babe
It's written all over your face, say it
A hurricane behind the door
So I've come ready for a war
Hey, babe
It's written all over your face, say it
So when you find out what we're fighting for
I'll be ready to talk
</p>
<p className="outro">
It's written all over your—
It's written all over your face
It's written all over your—
It's written all over your face
</p>

I went into the room with these people I’ve done a few sessions with, and I said, “Let’s try and take this as punk as I can get away with.” I suppose that’s where the Arctic Monkeys [inspiration] comes from; there are obviously punk elements within what they do. - Louis Tomlinson
