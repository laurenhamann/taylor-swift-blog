<p className="verse-one">
I saw you had a baby, did you
Use any of the names we liked?
And is your brother doin' okay?
Is he still gettin' out of fights?
I'm sorry that your mum don't like me
I'm sorry that I brought that on myself
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
They say bitter ends turn sweet in time
Is that true of yours and mine?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause if you're lonely in Chicago, you can call me, baby
Has it been long enough that you can forgive me?
Just because it didn't work doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
It just wasn't meant to be
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Have you seen how my life's been goin'?
'Cause I've been wondering what you'd say
Would you have told me to keep goin'?
Or would you say to walk away?
You always made me feel much bеtter
And I'll always be grateful for that
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Thеy say bitter ends turn sweet in time
Is that true of yours and mine?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And you feel lonely in Chicago, you can call me, baby
Has it been long enough that you can forgive me?
Just because it didn't work doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
I didn't have to search 'cause I still know your number
I bet that you didn't think that I'd remember
Just because it didn't work doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
It just wasn't meant to be
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
It just wasn't meant to be
No, it just wasn't meant to be
It just wasn't meant to be
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So, if you're lonely in Chicago, you can call me, baby
Has it been long enough that you can forgive me?
Just because it didn't work doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
Oh, I didn't have to search 'cause I still know your number
I bet sometimes you still like to wear my jumper
Just because it didn't work doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
It just wasn't meant to be
</p>
