<p className="verse-one">
Slowly, I never wanna go slowly
I only wanna go faster
Towards disaster every time
With me, I know you wanna come with me
Take anything you can carry
And leave everythin' else behind
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I am only half of what
I think I can be
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Gotta get it out of my system
Gotta get it off of my chest
I've lived a lot of my life already
But I gotta get through the rest
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Demons, I'm takin' all of my demons
Putting them where I won't see them
'Cause I just wanna feel alive
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I am only half of what
I think I can be
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Gotta get it out of my system
Gotta get it off of my chest
I've lived a lot of my life already
But I gotta get through the rest
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Gotta get it out of my system, system
Gotta get it out of my system
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Gotta get it out of my system
Gotta get it off of my chest
I've lived a lot of my life already
But I gotta get through the rest
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Gotta get it out of my system, system
Gotta get it out of my system
Gotta get it out of my system, system
Gotta get it out of my system
</p>
