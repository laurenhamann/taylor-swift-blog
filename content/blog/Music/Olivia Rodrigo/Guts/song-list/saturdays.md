<p className="verse-one">
I'm not supposed to be
Feelin' dirty cheap on Silver Street
At quarter to three
Hidden across my face
In the crowd, I'm countin' up the days
In a haze
I'm gazin' at the floor
Somebody's got your trainers on
The ones that you wore
When you walked out the door
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I've been wonderin' about what you're up to
Not for the first time
Not for the last time
And I've been thinking 'bout the things we used to do
Not for the first time
Not for the last time
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We always used to say
"Saturdays take the pain away"
Nobody stays the same
No matter how much you want it
Some things change
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Some things change
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Through my cigarette
A shadow of you sticks me to the carpet
Try to ignore it
Somethin' about the way
The light catches the mirror in my brain
It gives me shade
I'm starin' at the door
Somebody's got your trainers on
The ones that you wore
But you're not here anymore
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I've been wonderin' about what you're up to
Not for the first time
Not for the last time
And I've been thinking 'bout the things we used to do
Not for the first time
Not for the last time
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We always used to say
"Saturdays take the pain away"
Nobody stays the same
No matter how much you want it
Some things change
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Some things change
Some things change
Some things change
</p>
<p className="bridge">
My heart might be broken
But I won't be broken down
My heart might be broken
But I won't be broken down
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We always used to say
"Saturdays take the pain away"
Nobody stays the same
No matter how much you want it
How much you want it
We always used to say
"Saturdays take the pain away"
Nobody stays the same
No matter how much you want it
Some things change
</p>
