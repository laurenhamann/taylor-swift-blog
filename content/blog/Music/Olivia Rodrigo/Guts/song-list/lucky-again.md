<p className="verse-one">
You give and give until it's gone away
Just tell yourself you've got another day
You've lived that life, you just don't see it yet
I see how hard you've worked to be yourself
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If you believe that guy is Superman
They're selling tickets at the cinema
Whatever gets you through the darkest night
Just find the light out in the madness, hold tight
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I'm a hard man to lose
But I figured it out, then made my way back
To a life I would choose
We werе lucky once, I could be lucky again
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Beforе the world, it got so serious
Before the time, it got away from us
I'd meet you at the favourite subway stop
We grab some food, then meet the lads for one
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If you believe that guy is Superman
They're selling tickets at the cinema
Whatever gets you through the darkest night
Just find the light out in the madness, hold tight
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I'm a hard man to lose
But I figured it out, then made my way back
To a life I would choose
We were lucky once, could be lucky again
I'm a hard man to find
But you figured it out and I love you for that
Look back on a time
I was lucky once, I could be lucky again
</p>
