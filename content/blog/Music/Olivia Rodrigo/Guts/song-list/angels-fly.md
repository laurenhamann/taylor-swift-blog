<p className="verse-one">
Nothin' really matters
Nothin' really hurts
We can talk about it
It'll only make it worse
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
There's a time for sayin' who did what
Where it went wrong
I wanna hear all that, but right now
All I need you to know is
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You'll be okay, we can talk tomorrow
I'm on my way with some time to borrow
If every star is an eye in the sky
You'll see angels fly
I'll knock on your door, it'll save me from callin'
I won't say a word, it can wait till the mornin'
If every star is an eye in the sky
You'll see angels fly
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Look at the horizon
Does it make you feel small?
Put the pain behind you now
You don't need it anymore
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
There's a time for sayin' who did what
Wherе it went wrong
I wanna hear all that, but right now
You know it's not wherе we're goin'
There were problems in this empty bottle
At the bottom, but we drained all that
So, right now, all I need you to know is
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You'll be okay, we can talk tomorrow
I'm on my way with some time to borrow
If every star is an eye in the sky
You'll see angels fly
I'll knock on your door, it'll save me from callin'
I won't say a word, it can wait till the mornin'
If every star is an eye in the sky
You'll see angels fly
</p>
<p className="outro">
Angels fly
High
Angels fly
You'll see angels fly
Angels fly
High
Angels fly
You'll see angels fly
</p>
