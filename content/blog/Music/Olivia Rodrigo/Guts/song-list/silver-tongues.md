<p className="verse-one">
Gettin' high on the amber wave
Going deep for the ones who do the same
Air Maxes and silver tongues
Settle in for another heavy one
You said love was a pretty lie
And I choked when your smoke got in my eye
Bad logic and empty cans
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I know nobody understands
Me like you do
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You know, it's times like these we're so much happier
Nights like these, we'll remember thosе stupid jokes
Only we know
You know, when I'm with you, I'm so much happiеr
Nights like these, we'll remember those songs we wrote
Only we know
You smile at me and say, "It's time to go"
But I don't feel like goin' home
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You said grass was a dirty drug
You like to preach with a vodka in your mug
I love all the things you know
But I'm king on a fifty-metre road
We stand up tall and beat our chests
We shout some things that we'll regret
Sit down with a master plan
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I know nobody understands
Me like you do
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's times like these we're so much happier
Nights like these, we'll remember those stupid jokes
Only we know
You know, when I'm with you, I'm so much happier
Nights like these, we'll remember those songs we wrote
Only we know
You smile at me and say, "It's time to go"
But I don't feel like goin' home
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You and me until the end
Wakin' up to start again
You and me until the end
Wakin' up to start again
There's nowhere else that I would rather be
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Because it's times like these we're so much happier
Nights like these, we'll remember those stupid jokes
Only we know
You know, when I'm with you, I'm so much happier
Nights like these, we'll remember those songs we wrote
Only we know
You smile at me and say, "It's time to go"
But I don't feel like goin' home
</p>

That song was a great part of the writing process. On this record, I tried to write with less professional songwriters and more artists, and “Silver Tongues” is a good example of that. What you get with that is a different level of care and love for what you’re doing, instead of making it about money and trying to get the single. It’s not trying to be anything that it’s not. We were not trying to write a single, and there’s just a certain level of energy to it. - Louis Tomlinson
