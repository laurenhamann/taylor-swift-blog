<p className="verse-one">
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

</p>
<p className="">
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Do you call her, almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)
</p>

<p className="chorus">
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

</p>
<p className="bridge">
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

</p>

<p className="outro">
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I had this single picked out in September [2020] … so it sort of took the pressure off for me of following up “drivers license” since we planned this so far in advance. But it’s definitely not like “drivers license” at all, which I’m really happy about. I didn’t want to pigeonhole myself into this category of “sad ballad girl” thing. It’s definitely a little different, and sort of weird. I really hope that people like it, and even if they don’t, that’s cool too though, because I loved making it.
<br />
I’m sort of obsessed with the concept of deja vu, like I really love that concept. I get deja vu all the time. So, I thought it would be a cool like play on words to kind of use deja vu as a metaphor for like how, it’s a very universal thing that happens. You break up with someone, and they get with somebody else, and you kind of see them living the life you lived with them. […] It’s this super universal thing that happens to everyone that we just don’t talk about a ton.

I had this like line in my phone written for like a while “when she’s with you, do you get deja vu?” I was in the studio with Dan, and we were trying to write like a sad song, but it just wasn’t coming. So he’s like “What else do you have?” and I was like “I have this like line written” and he really liked it. So we kind of wrote it together, and created this whole like world. I really love painting pictures with songs, so we’ve tried to be really vivid with the lyrics.
