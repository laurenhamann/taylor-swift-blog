<p className="intro">
Ooh-ooh-ooh <br />
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-one">
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah <br />
I played dumb, but I always knew <br />
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse <br />
I kept quiet so I could keep you <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And ain't it funny how you ran to her <br />
The second that we called it quits? <br />
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends? <br />
Now it sure as hell don't look like it <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You betrayed me <br />
And I know that you'll never feel sorry <br />
For the way I hurt, yeah <br />
You talked to her when we were together <br />
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter <br />
It took you two weeks to go off and date her <br />
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
Now you bring her around just to shut me down <br />
Show her off like she's a new trophy <br />
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you <br />
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And ain't it funny? All the twisted games <br />
All the questions you used to avoid <br />
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up <br />
And you told me I was paranoid? <br />
</p>

<p className="chorus">
You betrayed me <br />
And I know that you'll never feel sorry <br />
For the way I hurt, yeah <br />
You talked to her when we were together <br />
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter <br />
It took you two weeks to go off and date her <br />
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor <br />
</p>

<p className="bridge">
(Ah-ah-ah) <br />
God, I wish that you had thought this through <br />
Before I went and fell in love with you <br />
(Ah-ah-ah) <br />
When she's sleepin' in the bed we made <br />
Don't you dare forget about the way <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You betrayed me <br />
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry <br />
For the way I hurt, yeah <br />
You talked to her when we were together <br />
You gave me your word, but that didn't matter <br />
It took you two weeks to go off and date her <br />
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still, you're still a traitor <br />
(Ah-ah-ah) <br />
Yeah, you're still a traitor <br />
</p>

<p className="outro">
Ooh-ooh-ooh <br />
God, I wish that you had thought this through <br />
Before I went and fell in love with you <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I wrote most of “traitor” on my bedroom floor in Salt Lake City. I sort of forgot about it until I sent a bunch of voice memos to Dan [Nigro] and he said he liked this. We finished it up together and I really like the way it turned out. It sort of feels like an old country song to me, which I’m obsessed with.
