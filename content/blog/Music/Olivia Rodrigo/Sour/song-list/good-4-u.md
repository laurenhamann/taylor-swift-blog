<p className="intro">
(Ah)
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do
</p>

<p className="chorus">
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
</p>
<p className="break">
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
</p>

<p className="chorus">
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
</p>
<p className="outro">
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I’m so stoked because my song “good 4 u” is out now! It’s a super angsty song inspired by some of my favorite pop punk bands. It’s one of my favorite songs on the record and I really hope you love it. Oh, and there’s also a sick music video for it. My friend Petra Collins directed it. We wanted to pay homage to the iconic feminist camp horror movies we love.
<br />
We wanted to take an early 2000s pop-punk song and sort of twist it and find a way to make it 2021…I hope people are surprised. I love pop-punk music; I love grunge music; I love country music and folk music. I think, honestly, you can see little influences of all of those genres in my album. And I didn’t want to make an entire record that sounded like ‘drivers license’. There’s no fun in that for me – and probably not for listeners, either.
<br />
