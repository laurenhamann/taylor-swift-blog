<p className="verse-one">
Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey
And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody
</p>
<p className="chorus">
The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wonder if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again
</p>

<p className="chorus">
All the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
</p>
<p className="bridge">
It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was goin' down, but I was doin' it with you
Yeah, everything we broke and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
Oh, look what we became
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
All the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
</p>
<p className="outro">
Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
'Cause, baby, you were mine
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
I was thinking a lot about this idea of, in order to get over a heartbreak, I think you have to forgive that person who caused you pain, but I think also that a big part of it is forgiving yourself. I found this little poem that I wrote in my notes app on my phone: “I know that I loved you so bad, I let you treat me like that.” I really liked that, I thought it grabbed you, so we made it the first line of the song.

I really like the lyric “One heart broke, four hands bloody.” Having the blame be on two people. Heartbreak is a two-way street, you couldn’t have gotten your heart broken if you didn’t put yourself in the position to be hurt. And I think writing this song sort of helped me forgive myself.

Dan & I wrote “favorite crime” sometime last summer I think. I had “Know I loved you so bad I let you treat me like that” written in my notes app for a while & it sort of sparked the entire song. I really love how the song is one big metaphor. Figurative language was something I had to work on in my songwriting. I’m a very literal, specific writer & metaphors & similes aren’t often where my brain tends to go, so I’m super proud of this song
