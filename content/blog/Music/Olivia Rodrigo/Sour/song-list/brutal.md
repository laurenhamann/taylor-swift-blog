<p className="intro">
I want it to be, like, messy <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-one">
I'm so insecure, I think <br />
That I'll die before I drink <br />
And I'm so caught up in the news <br />
Of who likes me and who hates you <br />
And I'm so tired that I might <br />
Quit my job, start a new life <br />
And they'd all be so disappointed <br />
'Cause who am I if not exploited? <br />
And I'm so sick of seventeen <br />
Where's my fucking teenage dream? <br />
If someone tells me one more time <br />
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry <br />
And I don't stick up for myself <br />
I'm anxious, and nothing can help <br />
And I wish I'd done this before <br />
And I wish people liked me more <br />
</p>

<p className="chorus">
All I did was try my best <br />
This the kinda thanks I get? <br />
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah) <br />
They say these are the golden years <br />
But I wish I could disappear <br />
Ego crush is so severe <br />
God, it's brutal out here <br />
</p>

<p className="post-chorus">
(Yeah) <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
I feel like no one wants me <br />
And I hate the way I'm perceived <br />
I only have two real friends <br />
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck <br />
'Cause I love people I don't like <br />
And I hate every song I write <br />
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart <br />
And I can't even parallel park <br />
</p>

<p className="chorus">
All I did was try my best <br />
This the kinda thanks I get? <br />
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah) <br />
They say these are the golden years <br />
But I wish I could disappear <br />
Ego crush is so severe <br />
God, it's brutal out here <br />
</p>

<p className="post-chorus">
(Yeah) <br />
(Just havin' a really good time) <br />
</p>

<p className="outro">
Got a broken ego, broken heart <br />
(Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here) <br />
And God, I don't even know where to start <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I told everyone that I wanted to make “brutal” the first track on the record, and they were like, “Girl, are you sure?” Just ‘cause it’s kind of a little polarizing, I think, but I absolutely love it. It’s a really angsty song I suppose, and I sort of just talk about everything that I’m upset about in the song, to put it very plainly and broadly.

I think it’s funny that we wrote the first track on the record kind of last minute, but it’s one of my favorites … I wrote [“brutal”]—and most of my songs—with my producer, Dan Nigro. He’s awesome. We were in the car listening to a bunch of old ‘90s songs and really liked that energy. Then he came up with this awesome riff.
