<p className="intro">
I want it to be, like, messy
</p>

<p className="verse-one">
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more
</p>

<p className="chorus">
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
</p>

<p className="post-chorus">
(Yeah)
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park
</p>

<p className="chorus">
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
</p>

<p className="post-chorus">
(Yeah)
(Just havin' a really good time)
</p>

<p className="outro">
Got a broken ego, broken heart
(Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here)
And God, I don't even know where to start
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I told everyone that I wanted to make “brutal” the first track on the record, and they were like, “Girl, are you sure?” Just ‘cause it’s kind of a little polarizing, I think, but I absolutely love it. It’s a really angsty song I suppose, and I sort of just talk about everything that I’m upset about in the song, to put it very plainly and broadly.

I think it’s funny that we wrote the first track on the record kind of last minute, but it’s one of my favorites … I wrote [“brutal”]—and most of my songs—with my producer, Dan Nigro. He’s awesome. We were in the car listening to a bunch of old ‘90s songs and really liked that energy. Then he came up with this awesome riff. - Olivia Rodrigo
