<p className="verse-one">
I wore makeup when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

</p>
<p className="verse-two">
And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

</p>
<p className="chorus">
You found someone more exciting, the next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

</p>

<p className="verse-three">
And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now, I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Before you found someone more exciting, the next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And don't you think I loved you too much
To be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much
To think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else
</p>

<p className="outro">
And they'll think that I am so exciting
And you'll be the one who's crying
Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied, but that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough for you
Enough for you, oh
No, nothing's enough for you
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I wrote “enough for you” entirely by myself which I’m very proud of. I wrote it literally on my bedroom floor. I actually was on “breakup” TikTok for a while, which is really funny. I was literally scrolling through TikTok and I found this really hopeful breakup video. It’s so embarrassing that this inspired this really emotional song, but I really was very inspired by this TikTok.
