<p className="verse-one">
I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me (He-he-he, he)
Started followin' me (He-he-he, he)
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos, I can't stand it
Oh God, I sound crazy
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Their win is not my loss
I know it's true, but
I can't help gettin' caught up in it all
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy (Yeah)

</p>
<p className="bridge">
All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life
Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend, too
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you
All I see is what I should be
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
All I see is what I should be
I'm losin' it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be (Oh, oh)
Anyone, anyone else (Anybody else)
Jealousy, jealousy
Oh, I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be (Oh-oh-oh)
Anyone, anyone else
Jealousy, jealousy started followin' me
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
[“jealousy, jealousy”] was one of the first songs that I wrote on the record with this wonderful writer named Casey Smith. In this time period, I was super obsessed with social media. I would look for things that would hurt my feelings all the time and compare myself to everyone. I felt like my life was only what I showed to others. I didn’t feel like my life was any deeper than my Instagram feed. That’s a really troubling mindset to be in as a teenager. And so I guess I wanted to write a song about that. It isn’t sad or “Oh, I don’t feel like I’m enough,” it’s "Oh, God, I’m so jealous.” It’s tongue-in-cheek, and a little funny to me. But the sonics on the song are the reason why we put it on the record. There’s this piano in the bridge that’s so convoluted and almost atonal. Sometimes it just doesn’t go with the music and it’s so chaotic.
<br />
I really was just writing about my experience, and I wrote [“jealousy, jealousy”] during a time where I was so consumed with how I looked on social media and how people perceived me. I was just, like, really upset in that head space and I wanted to write a song about it. It’s really cool that you say that and I hope that people can see themselves in the song a little bit, or maybe realize that social media is fake and nobody’s as perfect as they seem online.
