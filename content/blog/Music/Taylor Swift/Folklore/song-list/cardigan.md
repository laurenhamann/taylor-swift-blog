<p className="verse-one">
Vintage tee, brand new phone <br />
High heels on cobblestones <br />
When you are young, they assume you know nothing <br />
Sequin smile, black lipstick <br />
Sensual politics <br />
When you are young, they assume you know nothing <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But I knew you <br />
Dancin' in your Levi's <br />
Drunk under a streetlight <br />
I, I knew you <br />
Hand under my sweatshirt <br />
Baby, kiss it better, I <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan <br />
Under someone's bed <br />
You put me on and said I was your favorite <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
A friend to all is a friend to none <br />
Chase two girls, lose the one <br />
When you are young, they assume you know nothing <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But I knew you <br />
Playin' hide-and-seek and <br />
Givin' me your weekends <br />
I, I knew you <br />
Your heartbeat on the High Line <br />
Once in twenty lifetimes, I <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan <br />
Under someone's bed <br />
You put me on and said I was your favorite <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
To kiss in cars and downtown bars <br />
Was all we needed <br />
You drew stars around my scars <br />
But now I'm bleedin' <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I knew you <br />
Steppin' on the last train <br />
Marked me like a bloodstain <br />
I, I knew you <br />
Tried to change the ending <br />
Peter losin' Wendy <br />
I, I knew you <br />
Leavin' like a father <br />
Runnin' like water, I <br />
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss <br />
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs <br />
The smell of smoke would hang around this long <br />
'Cause I knew everything when I was young <br />
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time <br />
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line <br />
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired <br />
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light <br />
And I knew you'd come back to me <br />
You'd come back to me <br />
And you'd come back to me <br />
And you'd come back <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan <br />
Under someone's bed <br />
You put me on and said I was your favorite <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
The song is about a lost romance and why young love is often fixed so permanently within our memories. Why it leaves such an indelible mark.
<br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>
