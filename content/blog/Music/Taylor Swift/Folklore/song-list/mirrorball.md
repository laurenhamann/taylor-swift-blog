<p className="verse-one">
I want you to know <br />
I'm a mirrorball <br />
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight <br />
I'll get you out on the floor <br />
Shimmering beautiful <br />
And when I break it's in a million pieces <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hush <br />
When no one is around, my dear <br />
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes <br />
Spinning in my highest heels, love <br />
Shining just for you <br />
Hush <br />
I know they said the end is near <br />
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes <br />
Spinning in my highest heels, love <br />
Shining just for you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I want you to know <br />
I'm a mirrorball <br />
I can change everything about me to fit in <br />
You are not like the regulars <br />
The masquerade revelers <br />
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hush <br />
When no one is around, my dear <br />
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes <br />
Spinning in my highest heels, love <br />
Shining just for you <br />
Hush <br />
I know they said the end is near <br />
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes <br />
Spinning in my highest heels, love <br />
Shining just for you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And they called off the circus <br />
Burned the disco down <br />
When they sent home the horses <br />
And the rodeo clowns <br />
I'm still on that tightrope <br />
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me <br />
I'm still a believer but I don't know why <br />
I've never been a natural <br />
All I do is try, try, try <br />
I'm still on that trapeze <br />
<span id="favorite-line">I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me</span> <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Because I'm a mirrorball <br />
I'm a mirrorball <br />
I'll show you every version of yourself <br />
Tonight <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
In folklore, there are a lot of songs that reference each other, or lyrical parallels, and one of the ones I like is the entire song ‘this is me trying’ then being referenced again in ‘mirrorball.’ […] It also is the first time, and one of the only times, that the time that we’re living through is actually lyrically addressed. I think that, you know, the pandemic and lockdown, and all that, runs through this album like a thread because it’s an album that allows you to feel your feelings, and it’s a product of isolation. […] This is the first time, in the bridge saying, ‘they called off the circus, burned the disco down. When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns.’ I wrote this song right after I found out all my [Lover] shows were canceled. So it’s like I realize, here I am writing all this music, still trying. <br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>
