<p className="verse-one">
Make sure nobody sees you leave <br />
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down <br />
Tell your friends you're out for a run <br />
You'll be flushed when you return <br />
Take the road less traveled by <br />
Tell yourself you can always stop <br />
What started in beautiful rooms <br />
Ends with meetings in parking lots <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And that's the thing about illicit affairs <br />
And clandestine meetings and longing stares <br />
It's born from just one single glance <br />
But it dies, and it dies, and it dies <br />
A million little times <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Leave the perfume on the shelf <br />
That you picked out just for him <br />
So you leave no trace behind <br />
Like you don't even exist <br />
Take the words for what they are <br />
A dwindling, mercurial high <br />
A drug that only worked <br />
The first few hundred times <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And that's the thing about illicit affairs <br />
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares <br />
They show their truth one single time <br />
But they lie, and they lie, and they lie <br />
A million little times <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And you wanna scream <br />
Don't call me "kid" <br />
Don't call me "baby" <br />
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me <br />
You showed me colors <br />
You know I can't see with anyone else <br />
Don't call me "kid" <br />
Don't call me "baby" <br />
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me <br />
You taught me a secret language <br />
I can't speak with anyone else <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
And you know damn well <br />
For you, I would ruin myself <br />
A million little times <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/paul-mccartney-taylor-swift-musicians-on-musicians-1089058/">
When I was making folklore, I went lyrically in a total direction of escapism and romanticism. And I wrote songs imagining I was, like, a pioneer woman in a forbidden love affair [laughs]. <br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>
