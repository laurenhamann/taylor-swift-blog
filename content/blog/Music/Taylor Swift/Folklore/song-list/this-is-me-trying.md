<p className="verse-one">
I've been having a hard time adjusting <br />
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting <br />
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back <br />
I have a lot of regrets about that <br />
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout <br />
Could've followed my fears all the way down <br />
And maybe I don't quite know what to say <br />
But I'm here in your doorway <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I just wanted you to know <br />
That this is me trying <br />
I just wanted you to know <br />
That this is me trying <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
They told me all of my cages were mental <br />
So I got wasted like all my potential <br />
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad <br />
I have a lot of regrets about that <br />
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere <br />
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here <br />
Pourin' out my heart to a stranger <br />
But I didn't pour the whiskey <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I just wanted you to know <br />
That this is me trying <br />
I just wanted you to know <br />
That this is me trying <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
At least I'm trying <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And it's hard to be at a party <br />
When I feel like an open wound <br />
It's hard to be anywhere these days <br />
When all I want is you <br />
You're a flashback in a film reel <br />
On the one screen in my town <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I just wanted you to know <br />
That this is me trying (maybe I don't quite know what to say) <br />
I just wanted you to know <br />
That this is me trying <br />
At least I'm trying <br />
</p>
