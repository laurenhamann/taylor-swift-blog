<p className="verse-one">
Our coming-of-age has come and gone <br />
Suddenly the summer, it's clear <br />
I never had the courage of my convictions <br />
As long as danger is near <br />
And it's just around the corner, darling <br />
'Cause it lives in me <br />
No, I could never give you peace <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But I'm a fire, and I'll keep your brittle heart warm <br />
If your cascade ocean wave blues come <br />
All these people think love's for show <br />
But I would die for you in secret <br />
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me <br />
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Your integrity makes me seem small <br />
You paint dreamscapes on the wall <br />
I talk shit with my friends <br />
It's like I'm wasting your honor <br />
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences <br />
Sit with you in the trenches <br />
Give you my wild, give you a child <br />
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other <br />
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother <br />
Is it enough? <br />
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west <br />
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best <br />
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standing with me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But I'm a fire, and I'll keep your brittle heart warm <br />
If your cascade ocean wave blues come <br />
All these people think love's for show <br />
But I would die for you in secret <br />
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me <br />
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace? <br />
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace? <br />
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace? <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
‘peace’ is actually more rooted in my personal life. [It comes after] carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you’ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives. I can’t control if there’s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow. […] I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids. Whether that’s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture — the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it’s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That’s what that song “Peace” is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave? - Taylor Swift
