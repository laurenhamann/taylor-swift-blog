<p className="verse-one">
Green was the color of the grass <br />
Where I used to read at Centennial Park <br />
I used to think I would meet somebody there <br />
Teal was the color of your shirt <br />
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop <br />
You used to work at to make a little money <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Time, curious time <br />
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs <br />
Were there clues I didn't see? <br />
And isn't it just so pretty to think <br />
All along there was some <br />
Invisible string <br />
Tying you to me? <br />
Ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab <br />
On your first trip to LA <br />
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner <br />
Bold was the waitress on our three year trip <br />
Getting lunch down by the lakes <br />
She said I looked like an American singer <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Time, mystical time <br />
Cuttin' me open, then healin' me fine <br />
Were there clues I didn't see? <br />
And isn't it just so pretty to think <br />
All along there was some <br />
Invisible string <br />
Tying you to me? <br />
Ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
A string that pulled me <br />
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar <br />
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire <br />
Chains around my demons, wool to brave the seasons <br />
One single thread of gold tied me to you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind <br />
For the boys who broke my heart <br />
Now I send their babies presents <br />
Gold was the color of the leaves <br />
When I showed you around Centennial Park <br />
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Time, wondrous time <br />
Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies <br />
And it's cool, baby, with me <br />
And isn't it just so pretty to think <br />
All along there was some <br />
Invisible string <br />
Tying you to me? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ooh <br />
Hee <br />
Ooh <br />
</p>
