<p className="verse-one">
Keep your helmet <br />
Keep your life, son <br />
Just a flesh wound <br />
Here's your rifle <br />
Crawling up the beaches now <br />
Sir, I think he's bleedin' out <br />
And some things you just can't speak about <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
With you, I serve <br />
With you, I fall down <br />
Down <br />
Watch you breathin' <br />
Watch you breathin' out <br />
Out <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Something med school <br />
Did not cover <br />
Someone's daughter <br />
Someone's mother <br />
Holds your hand through plastic now <br />
Doc, I think she's crashin' out <br />
And some things you just can't speak about <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Only twenty minutes to sleep <br />
But you dream of some epiphany <br />
Just one single glimpse of relief <br />
To make some sense of what you've seen <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
With you, I serve <br />
With you, I fall down <br />
Down (down) <br />
Watch you breathin' <br />
Watch you breathin' out <br />
Out <br />
With you, I serve <br />
With you, I fall down (down) <br />
Down (down) <br />
Watch you breathin' <br />
Watch you breathin' out (out) <br />
Out <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Only twenty minutes to sleep <br />
But you dream of some epiphany <br />
Just one single glimpse of relief <br />
To make some sense of what you've seen <br />
</p>
