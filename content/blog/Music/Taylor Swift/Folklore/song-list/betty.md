<p className="verse-one">
Betty, I won't make assumptions <br />
About why you switched your homeroom <br />
But I think it's 'cause of me <br />
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard <br />
When I passed your house <br />
It's like I couldn't breathe <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You heard the rumors from Inez <br />
You can't believe a word she says <br />
Most times, but this time it was true <br />
The worst thing that I ever did <br />
Was what I did to you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But if I just showed up at your party <br />
Would you have me? <br />
Would you want me? <br />
Would you tell me to go fuck myself <br />
Or lead me to the garden? <br />
In the garden would you trust me <br />
If I told you it was just a summer thing? <br />
I'm only seventeen <br />
I don't know anything but I know I miss you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Betty, I know where it all went wrong <br />
Your favorite song was playing <br />
From the far side of the gym <br />
I was nowhere to be found <br />
I hate the crowds, you know that <br />
Plus, I saw you dance with him <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You heard the rumors from Inez <br />
You can't believe a word she says <br />
Most times, but this time it was true <br />
The worst thing that I ever did <br />
Was what I did to you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But if I just showed up at your party <br />
Would you have me? <br />
Would you want me? <br />
Would you tell me to go fuck myself <br />
Or lead me to the garden? <br />
In the garden would you trust me <br />
If I told you it was just a summer thing? <br />
I'm only seventeen <br />
I don't know anything but I know I miss you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I was walking home on broken cobblestones <br />
Just thinking of you when she pulled up <br />
Like a figment of my worst intentions <br />
She said "James, get in, let's drive" <br />
Those days turned into nights <br />
Slept next to her but <br />
I dreamt of you all summer long <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep <br />
And I planned it out for weeks now but <br />
It's finally sinking in <br />
Betty, right now is the last time <br />
I can dream about what happens when you see my face again <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
The only thing I wanna do <br />
Is make it up to you <br />
So, I showed up at your party <br />
Yeah, I showed up at your party <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Yeah, I showed up at your party <br />
Will you have me? <br />
Will you love me? <br />
Will you kiss me on the porch <br />
In front of all your stupid friends? <br />
If you kiss me <br />
Will it be just like I dreamed it? <br />
Will it patch your broken wings? <br />
I'm only seventeen <br />
I don't know anything <br />
But I know I miss you <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Standing in your cardigan <br />
Kissing in my car again <br />
Stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
[James] has lost the love of his life basically and doesn’t understand how to get it back. I think we all have these situations in our lives where we learn to really, really give a heartfelt apology for the first time. Everybody makes mistakes, everybody really messes up sometimes and this is a song that I wrote from the perspective of a 17-year-old boy. I’ve always loved that in music you can kinda slip into different identities and you can sing from other people’s perspectives. So that’s what I did on this one. I named all the characters in this story after my friends' kids… and I hope you like it! - Taylor Swift
