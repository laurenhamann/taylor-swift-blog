<p className="verse-one">
Please picture me <br />
In the trees <br />
I hit my peak at seven feet <br />
In the swing <br />
Over the creek <br />
I was too scared to jump in <br />
But I, I was high in the sky <br />
With Pennsylvania under me <br />
Are there still beautiful things? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Sweet tea in the summer <br />
Cross your heart, won't tell no other <br />
And though I can't recall your face <br />
I still got love for you <br />
Your braids like a pattern <br />
Love you to the moon and to Saturn <br />
Passed down like folk songs <br />
The love lasts so long <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I've been meaning to tell you <br />
I think your house is haunted <br />
Your dad is always mad and that must be why <br />
And I think you should come live with <br />
Me and we can be pirates <br />
Then you won't have to cry <br />
Or hide in the closet <br />
And just like a folk song <br />
Our love will be passed on <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Please picture me <br />
In the weeds <br />
Before I learned civility <br />
I used to scream ferociously <br />
Any time I wanted <br />
I, I <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Sweet tea in the summer <br />
Cross my heart, won't tell no other <br />
And though I can't recall your face <br />
I still got love for you <br />
Pack your dolls and a sweater <br />
We'll move to India forever <br />
Passed down like folk songs <br />
Our love lasts so long <br />
</p>
