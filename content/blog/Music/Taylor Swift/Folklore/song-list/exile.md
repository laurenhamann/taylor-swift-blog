<p className="verse-one">
I can see you standin', honey <br />
With his arms around your body <br />
Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all <br />
And it took you five whole minutes <br />
To pack us up and leave me with it <br />
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I think I've seen this film before <br />
And I didn't like the ending <br />
You're not my homeland anymore <br />
So what am I defendin' now? <br />
You were my town <br />
Now I'm in exile seein' you out <br />
I think I've seen this film before <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Hoo, hoo-ooh <br />
Hoo, hoo-ooh <br />
Hoo, hoo-ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I can see you starin', honey <br />
Like he's just your understudy <br />
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me <br />
Second, third, and hundredth chances <br />
Balancin' on breaking branches <br />
Those eyes add insult to injury <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I think I've seen this film before <br />
And I didn't like the ending <br />
I'm not your problem anymore <br />
So who am I offending now? <br />
You were my crown <br />
Now I'm in exile seein' you out <br />
I think I've seen this film before <br />
So I'm leavin' out the side door <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
So step right out <br />
There is no amount <br />
Of cryin' I can do for you <br />
All this time <br />
We always walked a very thin line <br />
You didn't even hear me out (you didn't even hear me out) <br />
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) <br />
All this time <br />
I never learned to read your mind (never learned to read my mind) <br />
I couldn't turn things around (you never turned things around) <br />
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) <br />
So many signs <br />
So many signs (you didn't even see the signs) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I think I've seen this film before <br />
And I didn't like the ending <br />
You're not my homeland anymore <br />
So what am I defending now? <br />
You were my town <br />
Now I'm in exile seein' you out <br />
I think I've seen this film before <br />
So I'm leaving out the side door <br />

<p className="outro">
So step right out <br />
There is no amount <br />

You didn't even hear me out (you didn't even hear me out) <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaRMwgmuTJA">
‘exile’ is a song that was written about miscommunications in relationships, and in the case of this song, I imagined that the miscommunications ended the relationship. They led to the demise of this love affair, and now these two people are seeing each other out for the first time, and they keep miscommunicating with each other. They can’t quite get on the same page, they never were able to. And even in their end, even after they’ve broken up, they’re still not hearing each other. So we imagined the beginning would be his side of the story, the second verse her side of the story, and the end would be the story of them talking over each other and not hearing each other. We’re really stoked about how it turned out because it really does seem to be about the tragedy of two people, of two ships passing in the night.<br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>

Taylor wrote that one with the singer-songwriter William Bowery. When Taylor sent it to me as a voice memo, she sang both the male and female parts—as much as she could fit in without losing her breath. We talked about who she was imagining joining her, and she loves Justin [Vernon]’s voice in Bon Iver and Big Red Machine. She was like, “Oh my god, I would die if he would do it. It would be so perfect.” I didn’t want to put pressure on Justin as his friend, so I said, “Well, it depends on if he’s inspired by the song but I know he thinks you’re rad.” Which he does. So I sent him the song and he was really into it. He tweaked some parts and added parts as well—the bridge where he says, “Step right out.” The end too, and his choral parts. It was fun because Justin and I work on a lot of stuff together, so it was very easy and natural. At some point I felt like a superfan, hearing two of my favorite singers. This was all being done remotely, but it was one of those moments where your head hits the back of the wall and you’re like, “Fuck. Okay.” <br /><b>- Aaron Dessner</b>
