<p className="verse-one">
3 a.m. and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine <br />
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine <br />
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree <br />
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles <br />
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love <br />
Oh, they sit around talkin' 'bout the meaning of life <br />
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But now that we're done and it's over <br />
I bet you couldn't believe <br />
When you realized I'm harder to forget, than I was to leave <br />
And I bet you think about me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community <br />
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills <br />
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion <br />
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-four">
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for <br />
And you and I fell like an early spring snow <br />
But reality crept in, you said we're too different <br />
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Mr. Superior-Thinkin' <br />
Do you have all the space that you need? <br />
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy <br />
And I bet you think about me <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I bet you think about me, yes <br />
I bet you think about me <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Ooh, block it all out <br />
The voices so loud sayin', "Why did you let her go?" <br />
Does it make you feel sad <br />
That the love that you're lookin' for <br />
Is the love that you had? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-five">
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul <br />
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old <br />
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free <br />
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But now that we're done and it's over <br />
I bet it's hard to believe <br />
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave <br />
Then, yeah, I bet you think about me <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I bet you think about me, yes <br />
I bet you think about me <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I bet you think about me when you're out <br />
At your cool indie music concerts every week <br />
I bet you think about me in your house <br />
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch <br />
I bet you think about me when you say <br />
"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me" <br />
I bet you think about me <br />
</p>

## Quote from artist

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/country1025wklb/status/1459212651326844931">
‘I Bet You Think About Me’ is a song I wrote with Lori McKenna, who is one of my favorite singer-songwriters ever. I’d always wanted to work with her. And I wrote this with her at her house when I was playing Foxboro Stadium on the Speak Now Tour [in June 2011]. We wanted this song to be like a comedic, tongue in cheek, funny, not caring what anyone thinks about you sort of break up song, because there are a lot of different types of heartbreak songs on Red. Some of them are very sincere, some of them are very stoic and heartbreaking and sad. We wanted this to be the moment where I was like, ‘I don’t care about anything.’ And we wanted to make people laugh with it, and we wanted it to be sort of a drinking song, and I think that that’s what it ended up being. - Taylor Swift
