<p className="verse-one">
I know I'm probably better off on my own <br />
Than lovin' a man who didn't know <br />
What he had when he had it <br />
And I see the permanent damage you did to me <br />
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I wish it wasn't 4am, standing in the mirror <br />
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it <br />
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again <br />
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br />
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand <br />
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br />
A better man <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I know I'm probably better off all alone <br />
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute <br />
And it was always on your terms <br />
I waited on every careless word <br />
Hoping it might turn sweet again <br />
Like it was in the beginning <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now <br />
You're talking down to me like I'll always be around <br />
You push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun <br />
Oh, you never thought I'd run <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again <br />
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br />
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand <br />
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man <br />
A better man <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have <br />
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that <br />
I wish you were a better man <br />
I wonder what we would've become <br />
If you were a better man <br />
We might still be in love <br />
If you were a better man <br />
You would've been the one <br />
If you were a better man <br />
Yeah, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again <br />
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man<br />
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand<br />
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man<br />
A better man<br />
<br />
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again <br />
(We might still be in love, if you were a better man)<br />
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man<br />
I know why we had to say goodbye<br />
Like the back of my hand<br />
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man<br />
A better man<br />
We might still be in love, if you were a better man<br />
You would've been the one<br />
If you were a better man<br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I was on tour, and I wrote it alone in a hotel room. And I remember standing in front of a mirror—I think the first thing I thought of was, ‘I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in a mirror, saying to myself, “you know you had to do it.”’ That was an actual visual from my life that ended up being the first thing I wrote, and then I expanded outward from there. And it was a song that I really thought belonged on the album and there were just too many songs I loved that I had written in that period of time, so some of them had to be left off. I think I chose ‘All Too Well’ over ‘Better Man.’ I think that was what happened. I was either going to put on ‘All Too Well’ or ‘Better Man,’ and then I left off ‘Better Man,’ and then later on, years later, Little Big Town ended up recording that song and it went to #1, it won CMA Song of the year, it was nominated for a Grammy. That was insane. It was like the coolest thing ever, and I’m so grateful to them for doing that, and now I get to put out my version of it, so pretty fun moment. - Taylor Swift
