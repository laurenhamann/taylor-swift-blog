<p className="verse-one">
I know that you like me <br />
And it's kinda frightenin' <br />
Standing here waitin', waitin' <br />
And I became hypnotized <br />
By freckles and bright eyes <br />
Tongue tied <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But now <br />
You're so far away and I'm down <br />
Feelin' like a face in the crowd <br />
I'm reachin' for you, terrified <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause you could be the one that I love <br />
I could be the one that you dream of <br />
Message in a bottle is all I can do <br />
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you <br />
You could be the one that I keep, and I <br />
Could be the reason you can't sleep at night <br />
Message in a bottle is all I can do <br />
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
These days I'm restless <br />
Work days are endless <br />
Look how you've made me, made me <br />
But time moves faster <br />
Replaying your laughter <br />
Disaster <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause now <br />
You're so far away and I'm down <br />
Feelin' like a face in the crowd <br />
I'm reachin' for you, terrified <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause you could be the one that I love <br />
I could be the one that you dream of <br />
Message in a bottle is all I can do <br />
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (it gets to you) <br />
You could be the one that I keep, and I (I) <br />
Could be the reason you can't sleep at night <br />
Message in a bottle is all I can do <br />
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
How is it in London? (London) <br />
Where are you while I'm wonderin' (wonderin') <br />
If I'll ever see you again? <br />
You could be the one that I love, mm-mm <br />
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause you could be the one that I love <br />
I could be the one that you dream of <br />
Message in a bottle is all I can do <br />
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (it gets to you) <br />
You could be the one that I keep, and I <br />
Could be the reason you can't sleep at night (you can't sleep at night) <br />
Message in a bottle is all I can do (yeah, yeah) <br />
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (yeah, yeah) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You could be the one that I love <br />
(Love) <br />
You could be the one that I love <br />
(Love) my love <br />
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' this gets to you <br />
