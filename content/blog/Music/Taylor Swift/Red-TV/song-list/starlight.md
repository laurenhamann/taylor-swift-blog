<p className="chorus">
I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window
We were seventeen and crazy running wild, wild
Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
He said, "Look at you, worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way"
He was tryna to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible things"
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Ooh, ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh dancing with me
Ooh, ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
</p>
<p className="chorus">
"Oh, my what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
</p>
<p className="outro">
Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible things
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-7x-UZMI5Q&t=37s">
It’s inspired by a photograph that I saw, and it’s a black and white photo. I saw it about two years ago, and this was before I knew anything extensive about, you know, Robert Kennedy and Ethel. I just saw this picture of these two young kids dancing at a dance, and below, it said ‘Ethel and Robert Kennedy, 1945, at age seventeen.’ And I wrote this song, just based on what I saw in the picture.

<blockquote>
I get a lot of style inspiration from the 1960s, so I’ll go and look at black and white pictures, and look at photos from the ‘50s and '60s, and I came across this picture of these two kids dancing at a dance. It immediately made me think of like how much fun they must have had that night. It was back in the late '40s. I ended up reading underneath that it was Ethel Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. And they were, like, 17. So I just kind of wrote that song from that place, not really knowing how they met or anything like that. And then her daughter Rory ended up coming to a show a couple weeks later and I told her about the song and she was like, 'you have to meet my mom, she would love to meet you.’ So that was kind of what that song was about. - Taylor Swift
