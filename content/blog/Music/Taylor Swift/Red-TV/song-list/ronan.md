<p className="verse-one">
I remember your bare feet down the hallway <br />
I remember your little laugh <br />
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs <br />
I love you to the moon and back <br />
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine <br />
Like we had our own secret club <br />
I remember you dancing before bedtime <br />
Then jumping on me, waking me up <br />
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man <br />
And even the moment I knew <br />
You fought it hard like an army guy <br />
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come on, baby, with me <br />
We're gonna fly away from here <br />
You were my best four years <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I remember the drive home when the blind hope <br />
Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?" <br />
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say <br />
About a beautiful boy who died <br />
And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything <br />
You wanted if you were still here <br />
I remember the last day when I kissed your face <br />
And whispered in your ear <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come on, baby, with me <br />
We're gonna fly away from here <br />
Out of this curtained room <br />
In this hospital grey, we'll just disappear <br />
Come on, baby, with me <br />
We're gonna fly away from here <br />
You were my best four years <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
What if I'm standing in your closet <br />
Trying to talk to you? <br />
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs <br />
You won't grow into? <br />
And what if I really thought some miracle <br />
Would see us through? <br />
What if the miracle was even getting <br />
One moment with you? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Come on, baby, with me <br />
We're gonna fly away from here <br />
Come on, baby, with me <br />
We're gonna fly away from here <br />
You were my best four years <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I remember your bare feet down the hallway <br />
I love you to the moon and back <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I’ve recently completed the re-recording of my 4th album, Red. It’s really exceeded my expectations in so many ways, and one of those ways is that I thought it would be appropriate to add ‘Ronan’ to this album. Red was an album of heartbreak and healing, of rage and rawness, of tragedy and trauma, and of the loss of an imagined future alongside someone. I wrote Ronan while I was making Red and discovered your story as you so honestly and devastatingly told it. My genuine hope is that you’ll agree with me that this song should be included on this album. - Taylor Swift
