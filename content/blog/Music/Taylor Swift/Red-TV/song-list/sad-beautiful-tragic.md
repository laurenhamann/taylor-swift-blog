<p className="verse-one">
Long handwritten note <br />
Deep in your pocket <br />
Words, how little they mean <br />
When you're a little too late <br />
I stood right by the tracks <br />
Your face in a locket <br />
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We had a beautiful magic love there <br />
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
In dreams <br />
I meet you in warm conversation <br />
We both wake <br />
In lonely beds <br />
In different cities <br />
And time <br />
Is taking its sweet time erasing you <br />
And you've got your demons <br />
And darlin' they all look like me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there <br />
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Distance, timing <br />
Breakdown, fighting <br />
Silence, the train runs off its tracks <br />
Kiss me, try to fix it <br />
Could you just try to listen? <br />
Hang up, give up <br />
For the life of us we can't get back <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
A beautiful magic love there <br />
What a sad <br />
Beautiful tragic <br />
Beautiful tragic <br />
Beautiful <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What we had a beautiful magic love there (uh-uh) <br />
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair <br />
We had a beautiful magic love there <br />
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj1WllQRkxo">
“Sad Beautiful Tragic” was a song that I wrote while I was on tour. I was on a tour bus that was moving and I just started playing this really haunting, sad chorus, and it was very simple, “What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair.” It was just reflecting on something that was lost and you can’t get it back. I went home and I called Nathan Chapman and said, “Hey, I wrote this song. Please, please, please, can we record today?” and, of course, he said, “Yes,” and we used that original demo on the [first version of] the album, because it just kind of came across so pure and raw.

‘Sad Beautiful Tragic’ is really close to my heart. I remember it was after a show and I was on the bus thinking about this relationship that ended months and months before. The feeling wasn’t sadness and anger or those things anymore. It was wistful loss. And so I just got my guitar and I hit on the fact that I was thinking in terms of rhyming; I rhymed magic with tragic, changed a few things and ended it with what a sad beautiful tragic love affair. I wanted to tell the story in terms of a cloudy recollection of what went wrong. It’s kind of the murky gray, looking back on something you can’t change or get back. - Taylor Swift
