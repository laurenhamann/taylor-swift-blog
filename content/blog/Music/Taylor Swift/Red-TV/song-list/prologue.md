Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heart-broken person
It was all over the place.

A fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end.

Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild
And tortured by memories past
These are the original thirty songs that were meant for Red
<br />
I love you guys
