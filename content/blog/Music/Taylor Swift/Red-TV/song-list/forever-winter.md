<p className="verse-one">
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days <br />
He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?" <br />
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be <br />
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I call just checkin' up on him <br />
He's up, 3 AM pacin' <br />
He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in" <br />
My voice comes out beggin' <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All this time I didn't know <br />
You were breakin' down <br />
I'd fall to pieces on the floor <br />
If you weren't around <br />
Too young to know it gets better <br />
I'll be summer sun for you forever <br />
Forever winter if you go <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
He seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and neverminds <br />
His laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard t <br />o breathe  <br />
I pull at every thread, tryna solve the puzzles in his head  <br />
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I call just checkin' up on him <br />
He's up, 5 AM wasted <br />
Long gone, not even listening <br />
My voice comes out screamin' <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All this time I didn't know <br />
You were breakin' down <br />
I'd fall to pieces on the floor <br />
If you weren't around <br />
Too young to know it gets better <br />
I'll be summer sun for you forever <br />
Forever winter if you go <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
If I was standin' there in your apartment <br />
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it <br />
I'd say I love you even at your darkest <br />
And please don't go <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I didn't know <br />
You were breakin' down <br />
I'd fall to pieces on the floor <br />
If you weren't around <br />
Too young to know it gets better <br />
I'll be summer sun for you forever <br />
Forever winter if you go <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I'll be your summer sun forever <br />
At 3 AM pacin' <br />
All this time I didn't know <br />
At 5 AM wasted <br />
I'd be in pieces on the floor <br />
Forever winter if you go <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days <br />
I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away" <br />
