<p className="intro">
One, two, three, four <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around <br />
We shouldn't be in this town <br />
And my so-called friends, they don't know <br />
I'd drive away before I let you go <br />
So give me a reason and don't say no, no <br />
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote <br />
"I'll wait for you" <br />
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame <br />
Take it with you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And run, like you'd run from the law <br />
Darling, let's run <br />
Run from it all <br />
We can go where our eyes can take us <br />
Go where no one else is, run <br />
Oo-oo-oo, we'll run <br />
Oo-oo-oo, we'll run <br />
Oo-oo-oo, we'll run <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
So you laugh like a child <br />
And I'll sing like no one cares <br />
No one to be, no one to tell <br />
I could see this view a hundred times <br />
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes <br />
So give me a reason and don't say no, no <br />
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket <br />
Since I gave it to you <br />
There's a heart on your sleeve <br />
I'll take it when I leave <br />
And hold it for you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And run, like you'd run from the law <br />
Darling, let's run <br />
Run from it all <br />
We can go like they're trying to chase us <br />
Go where no one else is, run <br />
Oo-oo-oo, we'll run <br />
Oo-oo-oo, we'll run <br />
Oo-oo-oo, we'll run <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
There's been this hole in my heart <br />
This thing was a shot in the dark <br />
Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart <br />
And I'll hold onto you while we run (and we run, and we run, and we run) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Like you'd run from the law (and we run, and we run, and we run) <br />
Darling, let's run (and we run, and we run, and we run) <br />
Run from it all (and we run, and we run, and we run) <br />
We can go where our eyes can take us (and we run, and we run, and we run) <br />
Go where no one else is, run (and we run, and we run, and we run) <br />
Oo-oo-oo, we'll run (and we run, and we run, and we run) <br />
Oo-oo-oo, we'll run (and we run, and we run, and we run)<br />
Oo-oo-oo, we'll run (and we run, and we run, and we run)<br />
Oo-oo-oo, and we'll run <br />
</p>
