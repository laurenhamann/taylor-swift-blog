<p className="intro">
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah <br />
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
I don't even know her <br />
But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right <br />
It's kinda like a code, yeah <br />
And you've been getting closer and closer, and crossing so many lines <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And it would be a fine proposition <br />
If I was a stupid girl <br />
But honey, I am no-one's exception <br />
This I have previously learned <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah <br />
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br />
I see you turn off your phone <br />
And now you got me alone, and I say <br />
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I just wanna make sure <br />
You understand perfectly, you're the kind of man who makes me sad <br />
While she waits up <br />
You chase down the newest thing and take for granted what you have <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And it would be a fine proposition <br />
If I was a stupid girl <br />
And yeah, I might go with it <br />
If I hadn't once been just like her <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah <br />
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br />
I see you turn off your phone <br />
And now you got me alone, and I say <br />
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Call a cab, lose my number, you're about to lose your girl <br />
Call a cab, lose my number, let's consider this lesson learned <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah <br />
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br />
Want to see you pick up your phone <br />
And tell her you're coming home <br />
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br />
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br />
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
It would be a fine proposition <br />
If I hadn't once been just like her <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj1WllQRkxo">
I wrote the song “Girl At Home” about a guy who I knew had a girlfriend and I thought it was kind of gross that he was hitting on me, so I just kind of put myself in her position and thought about the fact that, if it had been years ago, I would have been flattered and, “Oh, wow, somebody’s flirting with me,” and then you get cheated on once or twice and you’re like, “Stop it! You have a girlfriend!” I guess that song was my response to some lessons I’ve learned in the past. - Taylor Swift
