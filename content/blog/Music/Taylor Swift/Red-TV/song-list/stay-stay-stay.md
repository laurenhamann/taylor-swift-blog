<p className='verse-one'>
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night <br />
I threw my phone across the room at you <br />
I was expecting some dramatic turn away <br />
But you stayed <br />
This morning I said we should talk about it <br />
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved  <br />
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet <br />
And said, "Okay, let's talk" <br />
And I said <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Stay, stay, stay <br />
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br />
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br />
But I think that it's best if we both stay <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Before you, I'd only dated self indulgent takers <br />
Who took all of their problem out on me <br />
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing <br />
And I love you, because you have given me no choice but to <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Stay, stay, stay <br />
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br />
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br />
But I think that it's best if we both stay <br />
Stay, stay, stay <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You took the time to memorize me <br />
My fears, my hopes and dreams <br />
I just like hanging out with you <br />
All the time <br />
All those times that you didn't leave <br />
It's been occurring to me <br />
I'd like to hang out with you <br />
For my whole life <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Stay <br />
And I'll be loving you for quite some time <br />
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad <br />
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay <br />
Stay, stay, stay <br />
Stay, stay, stay <br />
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br />
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br />
But I think that it's best if we both stay <br />
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Stay, stay, stay <br />
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br />
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br />
I think that it's best if we both stay <br />
"That's so fun" <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj1WllQRkxo">
The song “Stay Stay Stay” is a song that I wrote based on what I’ve seen of real relationships, where it’s not perfect, there are moments where you’re just so sick of that person and you get into a stupid fight, and it’s still worth it to stay in it, because there’s something about it that you can’t live without. In the bridge, it says “I’d like to hang out with you for my whole life”, and I think that’s probably the key to finding the one, is you just want to hang out with them forever. - Taylor Swift
