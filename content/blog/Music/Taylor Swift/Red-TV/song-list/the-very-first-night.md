<p className="chorus">
I wish I could fly <br />
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time <br />
I'd write this in the sky <br />
I miss you like it was the very first night <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
And so it goes, every weekend, the same party <br />
I never go alone and I don't seem broken-hearted <br />
My friends all say they know everything I'm going through <br />
I drive down different roads but they all lead back to you <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel  <br />
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell <br />
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture <br />
They don't know how much I miss you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wish I could fly <br />
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time <br />
I'd write this in the sky <br />
I miss you like it was the very first night <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
And so it was, we never saw it comin' <br />
Not tryin' to fall in love, but we did like children runnin' <br />
Back then we didn't know we were built to fall apart <br />
We broke the status quo, then we broke each other's hearts <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But don't forget about the night out in L.A. <br />
Danced in the kitchen, chased me down through the hallway <br />
No one knows about the words that we whispered <br />
No one knows how much I miss you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wish I could fly <br />
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time <br />
I'd write this in the sky <br />
I miss you like it was the very first night <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Take me away, take me away <br />
Take me away to you, to you <br />
Take me away, take me away <br />
Take me away to you, to you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I remember the night at the hotel <br />
I was ridin' in the car when we both fell <br />
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper <br />
"Do you know how much I miss you?" <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
I wish that we could go back in time <br />
And I'd say to you <br />
I miss you like it was the very first night <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wish I could fly <br />
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time <br />
I'd write this in the sky <br />
I miss you like it was the very first night <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
take me away <br />
(Take) take me away to you, to you <br />
(Take) take me away, (take) take me away <br />
(Take) take me away to you, to you <br />
</p>
