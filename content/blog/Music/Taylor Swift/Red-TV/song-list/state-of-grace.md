<p className="verse-one">
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights <br />
Busy streets and busy lives <br />
And all we know is touch and go <br />
We are alone with our changing minds <br />
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I never (never) <br />
Saw you coming <br />
And I'll never (never) <br />
Be the same <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You come around and the armor falls <br />
Pierce the room like a cannonball <br />
Now all we know is don't let go <br />
We are alone, just you and me <br />
Up in your room and our slates are clean <br />
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes <br />

So you were never a saint <br />
And I've loved in shades of wrong <br />
We learn to live with the pain <br />
Mosaic broken hearts <br />
But this love is brave and wild <br />

</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I never (never) <br />
Saw you coming <br />
And I'll never (never) <br />
Be the same <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is a state of grace <br />
This is the worthwhile fight <br />
Love is a ruthless game <br />
Unless you play it good and right <br />
These are the hands of fate <br />
You're my Achilles heel <br />
This is the golden age of something good and right and real <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I never (never) <br />
Saw you coming <br />
And I'll never <br />
Be the same <br />
And I never (never) <br />
Saw you coming <br />
And I'll never (so you were never a saint) <br />
(And I've loved in shades of wrong) <br />
Be the same (we learn to live with the pain) <br />
(Mosaic broken hearts) <br />
(But this love is brave and wild) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
This is a state of grace <br />
This is the worthwhile fight <br />
Love is a ruthless game <br />
Unless you play it good and right <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
State of Grace is a song I wrote at the beginning process of making this album, and I think it helps to define what the rest of the record is about, just with one line. There’s a line in the song that says ‘Love is a ruthless game, nless you play it good and right’.
That’s kind of like a warning, for the rest of the record. This is what’s going to happen if you don’t play this right. This is what could happen if you do. It almost serves as the perfect kind of warning label for the rest of the record. As soon as you hear that song, there are two ways this could go, you could be good to people, or you could not play fair, and both the outcomes are reflected on the record. - Taylor Swift

<blockquote>
I wrote this song about when you first fall in love with someone the possibilities, kind of thinking about the different ways that it could go. It’s a really big sound. To me, this sounds like the feeling of falling in love in an epic way - Taylor Swift
