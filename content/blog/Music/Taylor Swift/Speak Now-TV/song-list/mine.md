<p className="verse-one">
You were in college working part-time waiting tables <br />
Left a small town, never looked back <br />
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling <br />
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I say, "Can you believe it?" <br />
As we're lying on the couch <br />
The moment I can see it <br />
Yes, yes, I can see it now <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? <br />
You put your arm around me for the first time <br />
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter <br />
You are the best thing that's ever been mine <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together <br />
And there's a drawer of my things at your place <br />
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded <br />
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But we got bills to pay <br />
We got nothing figured out <br />
When it was hard to take <br />
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? <br />
You put your arm around me for the first time <br />
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter <br />
You are the best thing that's ever been mine <br />
Do you remember all the city lights on the water? <br />
You saw me start to believe for the first time <br />
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter <br />
You are the best thing that's ever been mine <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m. <br />
As everything was slipping right out of our hands <br />
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street <br />
Braced myself for the goodbye <br />
'Cause that's all I've ever known <br />
Then you took me by surprise <br />
You said, "I'll never leave you alone" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You said <br />
"I remember how we felt sitting by the water <br />
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time <br />
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter <br />
She is the best thing that's ever been mine" <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Hold on <br />
Make it last <br />
Hold on <br />
Never turn back <br />
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on) <br />
You are the best thing that's ever been mine <br />
Do you believe it? (Hold on) <br />
We're gonna make it now (hold on) <br />
And I can see it (yeah, yeah) <br />
I can see it now <br />
</p>
