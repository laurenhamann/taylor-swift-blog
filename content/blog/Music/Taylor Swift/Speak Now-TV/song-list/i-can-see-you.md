<p className="intro">
I-I-I-I <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
You brush past me in the hallway <br />
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya? <br />
I've been watchin' you for ages <br />
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But what would you do if I went to touch you now? <br />
What would you do if they never found us out? <br />
What would you do if we never made a sound? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me <br />
And I could see you up against the wall with me <br />
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew <br />
That I can see you <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I-I-I-I <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
And we kept everything professional <br />
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like <br />
They keep watchful eyes on us <br />
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet <br />
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head <br />
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But what would you do if I went to touch you now? <br />
What would you do if they never found us out? <br />
What would you do if we never made a sound? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me <br />
And I could see you up against the wall with me <br />
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh <br />
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor <br />
I could see you, make me want you even more <br />
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew <br />
That I can see you <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I-I-I-I <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I can see you in your suit and your necktie <br />
Passed me a note sayin', "Meet me tonight" <br />
Then we kiss and you know I won't ever tell, yeah <br />
And I could see you being my addiction <br />
You can see me as a secret mission <br />
Hide away and I will start behaving myself <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I-I-I-I <br />
Oh-oh, oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I can see you waitin' down the hall from me <br />
And I could see you up against the wall with me <br />
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh <br />
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor <br />
I could see you, make me want you even more <br />
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew <br />
That I can see you, oh, I can see you <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, I see you, I see you, baby <br />
I see you <br />
(I-I-I-I) I see you, I see you, baby <br />
Oh, baby <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
WELL. SO. Iâ€™ve been counting down for months and finally the â€˜I Can See Youâ€™ video is out. I wrote this video treatment over a year ago and really wanted to play out symbolically how itâ€™s felt for me to have the fans helping me reclaim my music. I had my heart set on Joey King, Taylor Lautner and Presley Cash starring in it. Joey and Presley had been in the video for â€˜Meanâ€™ when they were 9 and 13 and they are back and so ridiculously bad ass!! Taytay is INCREDIBLE in this (didnâ€™t have a stunt double!) and shout out to Tay Lautner for being so awesome to hang with on set. The Tale of 3 Taylors ðŸ˜† I always wanted to direct fight scenes/a heist storyline and had the most incredible time plotting this out with my amazing DP Jonathan Sela. So proud of this one.
