<p className="verse-one">
My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand <br />
Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans <br />
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again <br />
You give me just enough  attention to keep my hopes too high <br />
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right <br />
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And the voices say, "You are not the exception <br />
You will never learn your lesson"
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Foolish one <br />
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love <br />
That ain't never gonna come <br />
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You know how to keep me waitin' <br />
I know how to act like I'm fine <br />
Don't know what to call this situation <br />
But I know I can't call you mine <br />
And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof <br />
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder <br />
It starts thinkin' you'll come around <br />
And maybe, someday, when we're older <br />
This is something we'll laugh about <br />
Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But then the voices say, "You are not the exception <br />
You will never learn your lesson"
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Foolish one <br />
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love <br />
That ain't never gonna come <br />
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down <br />
Foolish one <br />
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love <br />
That ain't never gonna come <br />
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands <br />
Sayin', "How could I not see the signs?" <br />
Oh, you haven't written me or called <br />
But goodbye screamin' in the silence <br />
And the voices in my head are tellin' me why <br />
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings <br />
I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring <br />
And you will say you had the best of intentions <br />
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Foolish one <br />
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love <br />
That ain't never gonna come <br />
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down <br />
Foolish one <br />
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love <br />
That ain't never gonna come <br />
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out
</p>
<p className="outro">
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la-la <br />
Ain't never gonna come <br />
Ooh, you will learn the hard way now <br />
Foolish one <br />
Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love <br />
They ain't never gonna come <br />
And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out <br />
Foolish one <br />
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love <br />
When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one <br />
No, he just wasn't the one
</p>
