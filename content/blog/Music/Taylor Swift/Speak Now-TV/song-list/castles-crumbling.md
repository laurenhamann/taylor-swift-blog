<p className="intro">
(Once, I had an empire) <br />
(Once, I had an empire) <br />
(Once, I had an empire)
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Once, I had an empire in a golden age <br />
I was held up so high, I used to be great <br />
They used to cheer when they saw my face <br />
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down <br />
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground <br />
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down <br />
You don't wanna know me now
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty<br />
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me<br />
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far<br />
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Power went to my head and I couldn't stop <br />
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off<br />
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret<br />
Falling down like promises that I never kept
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down <br />
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground <br />
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down <br />
You don't wanna know me now
</p>
<p className="bridge">
My foes and friends watch my reign end <br />
I don't know how it could've ended this way <br />
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor <br />
People look at me like I'm a monster <br />
Now they're screamin' at the palace front gates <br />
Used to chant my name <br />
Now they're screaming that they hate me <br />
Never wanted you to hate me
</p>
<p className="chorus">
My castle's crumbling down <br />
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground <br />
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down (Just let you down) <br />
My castle's crumbling down <br />
You don't wanna know me now, now
</p>
<p className="outro">
(Once, I had an empire)<br />
(Once, I had an empire)<br />
(Once, I had an empire)
</p>
