<p className="intro">
(Once, I had an empire) <br />
(Once, I had an empire) <br />
(Once, I had an empire)
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Once, I had an empire in a golden age <br />
I was held up so high, I used to be great <br />
They used to cheer when they saw my face <br />
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I <b>feel like my castle's crumbling down<br />
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground <br />
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down</b> <br />
You don't wanna know me now
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
<em>Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty<br />
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me</em><br />
<b>Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far</b><br />
<em>I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart</em>
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
<b>Power went to my head and I couldn't stop <br />
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off</b><br />
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret<br />
<b>Falling down like promises that I never kept</b>
</p>
<p className="chorus">
<b>And I feel like my castle's crumbling down <br />
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground <br />
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down </b><br />
You don't wanna know me now
</p>
<p className="bridge">
My foes and friends watch my reign end <br />
I don't know how it could've ended this way <br />
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor <br />
People look at me like I'm a monster <br />
Now they're screamin' at the palace front gates <br />
Used to chant my name <br />
Now they're screaming that they hate me <br />
Never wanted you to hate me
</p>
<p className="chorus">
My castle's crumbling down <br />
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground <br />
And you don't want to know me, <b>I will just let you down (Just let you down) </b><br />
My castle's crumbling down <br />
You don't wanna know me now, now
</p>
<p className="outro">
(Once, I had an empire)<br />
(Once, I had an empire)<br />
(Once, I had an empire)

## Quotes from Artists

<blockquote>
[Working with Taylor] was really special because we have known each other for a really long time in different stages of our lives. We connected in the beginning when Paramore was just sort of starting to break out and kind of become a popular band, and she had already been successful in country [music] but she was kind of nearing her crossover moment, and it was very exciting. I was also very thankful to know someone that was my age, that was in a similar position to me. And over the years, whether we’ve been in contact consistently or not, I’ve just always been really grateful to know I’m not alone in it. She has so many experiences that I can’t even fathom. There’s been so much added pressure that I know nothing about, and the scale of it is something that’s so much grander than Paramore has experienced even, but I think we’ve found such a good honest connection of just trying to be good stewards of the opportunity that we’ve both been given in music. Like, how do we actually use this in the best way that we can? How do we share these opportunities with the right people? How do we experience this and be fully present for it? And I really look up to her for that. But as far as “Castles Crumbling” goes, I heard the song and was super surprised by the storytelling in it, which is no surprise because it’s a Taylor Swift song, but it’s about an experience that we’ve both shared growing up in the public eye and I just feel very honoured to get to sing about that feeling. And yeah, I just really love it. I love it. I can’t believe I got to be a part of it.
