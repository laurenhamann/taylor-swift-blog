<p className="verse-one">
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm <br />
And I'm a house of cards <br />
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running <br />
But I kinda know that I won't get far <br />
And you stood there in front of me just <br />
Close enough to touch <br />
Close enough to hope you couldn't see <br />
What I was thinking of <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Drop everything now <br />
Meet me in the pouring rain <br />
Kiss me on the sidewalk <br />
Take away the pain <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Get me with those green eyes, baby <br />
As the lights go down <br />
Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile <br />
My mind forgets to remind me, you're a bad idea <br />
You touch me once and it's really something <br />
You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be <br />
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world <br />
But with you I know its no good <br />
And I could wait patiently <br />
But I really wish you would <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Drop everything now <br />
Meet me in the pouring rain <br />
Kiss me on the sidewalk <br />
Take away the pain <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile <br />
Get me with those green eyes, baby <br />
As the lights go down <br />
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I run my fingers through your hair <br />
And watch the lights go wild <br />
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me <br />
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right <br />
And lead me up the staircase <br />
Won't you whisper soft and slow <br />
And I'm captivated by you baby <br />
Like a fireworks show <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Drop everything now <br />
Meet me in the pouring rain <br />
Kiss me on the sidewalk <br />
Take away the pain <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile <br />
Get me with those green eyes, baby <br />
As the lights go down <br />
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around <br />
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
When sparks fly oh baby smile <br />
When sparks fly <br />
</p>
