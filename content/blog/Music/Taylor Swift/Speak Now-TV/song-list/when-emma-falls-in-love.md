<p className="verse-one">
When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor <br />
Closes the blinds and locks the door <br />
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom <br />
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong <br />
She waits and takes her time <br />
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain <br />
When Emma falls in love, I know <br />
That boy will never be the same <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down <br />
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town <br />
And all the bad boys would be good boys <br />
If they only had a chance to love her <br />
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face <br />
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space <br />
When Emma falls in love, she disappears <br />
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years <br />
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone <br />
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own <br />
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps <br />
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And she's the kind of book that you can't put down <br />
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town <br />
And all the bad boys would be good boys <br />
If they only had a chance to love her <br />
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A.​​ <br />
She won't lose herself in love the way that I did <br />
'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place <br />
When Emma falls in love, I'm learning <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Emma met a boy with eyes like a man <br />
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand <br />
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains <br />
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down <br />
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town <br />
And all the bad boys would be good boys <br />
If they only had a chance to love her <br />
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her <br />
</p>
