<p className="verse-one">
Elevator buttons and morning air <br />
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs <br />
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares <br />
But right now my time is theirs <br />
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves <br />
They'll judge it like they know about me and you <br />
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do <br />
The jury's out, but my choice is you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So don't you worry your pretty, little mind <br />
People throw rocks at things that shine <br />
And life makes love look hard <br />
The stakes are high, the water's rough <br />
But this love is ours <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You never know what people have up their sleeves <br />
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me <br />
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles <br />
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine <br />
And you'll say <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't you worry your pretty, little mind <br />
People throw rocks at things that shine <br />
And life makes love look hard <br />
The stakes are high, the water's rough <br />
But this love is ours <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And it's not theirs to speculate <br />
If it's wrong, and your hands are tough <br />
But they are where mine belong, and <br />
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith <br />
With this song for you <br />
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth <br />
And I love the riddles that you speak <br />
And any snide remarks from my father <br />
About your tattoos will be ignored <br />
'Cause my heart is yours <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So don't you worry your pretty, little mind <br />
People throw rocks at things that shine <br />
And life makes love look hard <br />
And don't you worry your pretty, little mind <br />
People throw rocks at things that shine <br />
But they can't take what's ours <br />
They can't take what's ours <br />
The stakes are high, the water's rough <br />
But this love is ours <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I’m excited about telling the beginnings of stories, like the story of this song called ‘Ours,’ where I wrote it about this guy nobody thought I should be with. So I wrote this song specifically just to play it for him, just to show him, ‘I don’t care what anyone says. I don’t care that you have tattoos. I don’t care that you have a gap between your teeth. I love you for who you are.’ And that song ended up actually making it on [Speak Now] and becoming a #1 song. - Taylor Swift
