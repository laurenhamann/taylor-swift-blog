<p className="verse-one">
Down the block, there's an antique shop <br />
And something in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in <br />
On the counter was a cardboard box <br />
And the sign said, "Photos: twenty-five cents each" <br />
Black and white, saw a 30s bride <br />
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house <br />
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime <br />
The kind you don't put down
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain <br />
But in those photos, I saw us instead <br />
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other <br />
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met
</p>
<p className="chorus">
On a crowded street in 1944 <br />
And you werе headed off to fight in the war <br />
You still would've been mine <br />
We would have been timeless <br />
I would've read your love letters every single night <br />
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right <br />
And you would've been fine <br />
We would have been timeless <br />
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this <br />
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine <br />
We would've been timeless
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I had to smile when it caught my eye <br />
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway <br />
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance <br />
And the date on the back said 1958 <br />
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you <br />
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop <br />
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round <br />
At these precious things that time forgot
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs <br />
Story of a romance torn apart by fate <br />
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did <br />
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face
</p>
<p className="chorus">
In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land <br />
And I was forced to marry another man <br />
You still would've been mine <br />
We would have been timeless <br />
I would've read your love letters every single night <br />
And run away and left it all behind <br />
You still would've been mine <br />
We would've been timeless <br />
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this <br />
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine <br />
We would've been timeless
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Time breaks down your mind and body <br />
Don't you let it touch your soul <br />
It was like an age-old classic <br />
The first time that you saw me <br />
The story started when you said, "Hello"
</p>

<p className="chorus">
In a crowded room a few short years ago <br />
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know <br />
You're always gonna be mine <br />
We're gonna be <br />
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray <br />
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made <br />
And you'll say, "Oh my, we really were timeless"
</p>

<p className="post-chorus">
We're gonna be timeless, timeless <br />
You still would've been mine <br />
We would've been <br />
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944 <br />
You still would've been mine <br />
We would've been
</p>
