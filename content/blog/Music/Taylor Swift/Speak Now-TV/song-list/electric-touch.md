<em>Fall Out Boy</em>

<b>All</b>
</p>

<p className="verse-one">
Just breathe, just relax,  it'll be okay <br />
Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway <br />
Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight <br />
I've got my money on things goin' badly <br />
Got a history of stories ending sadly <br />
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me <br />
Just one time, just one time <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life <br />
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life <br />
And I want you now, wanna need you forever <br />
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
<em>I've been left in the rain lost and pining <br />
I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying <br />
'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)</em> <br />
<b>I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone <br />
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone </b> <br />
<em>Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right</em> <br />
<b>Just one time, just one time</b> <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
<em>All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life <br />
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life <br />
And I want you now, wanna need you forever <br />
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm</em> <br />
</p> 
<p className="bridge">
I was thinking just one time <em>(Just one time)</em> <br />
Maybe the stars align <em>(Just one time)</em> <br />
And maybe I call you mine <br />
And you won't need space <br />
Or string me along while you decide <br />
And just one time <em>(Just one time)</em> <br />
Maybe the moment's right <em>(The moment's right)</em> <br />
It's 8:05 and I see two headlights <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
<b>All I know is this could either break my heart</b> or bring it back to life <br />
Got a feelin' your electric touch <em>(Ooh)</em> <br />
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life <br />
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill  <br />this ghost town up with life (Life) <br />
And I want you now, wanna need you forever <br />
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm <br />
</p>
