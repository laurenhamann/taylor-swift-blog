<p className="verse-one">
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us <br />
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly <br />
People would say they're the lucky ones <br />
I used to know my place was a spot next to you <br />
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat <br />
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh, a simple complication <br />
Miscommunications lead to fall out <br />
So many things that I wish you knew <br />
So many walls up, I can't break through <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room <br />
And we're not speaking <br />
And I'm dying to know <br />
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah <br />
I don't know what to say <br />
Since a twist of fate, when it all broke down <br />
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
(Next chapter) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
How'd we end up this way? <br />
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy <br />
And you're doing your best to avoid me <br />
I'm starting to think, one day, I'll tell the story of us <br />
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here <br />
But you held your pride like you should've held me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending <br />
Why are we pretending this is nothing? <br />
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how <br />
I never heard silence quite this loud <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room <br />
And we're not speaking <br />
And I'm dying to know <br />
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah <br />
I don't know what to say <br />
Since a twist of fate, when it all broke down <br />
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
This is looking like a contest <br />
Of who can act like they care less <br />
But I liked it better when you were on my side <br />
The battle's in your hands now <br />
But I would lay my armor down <br />
If you say you'd rather love than fight <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
So many things that you wish I knew <br />
But the story of us might be ending soon <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room <br />
And we're not speaking <br />
And I'm dying to know <br />
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah <br />
But I don't know what to say <br />
Since a twist of fate, when it all broke down <br />
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now <br />
And we're not speaking <br />
And I'm dying to know <br />
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah <br />
I don't know what to say <br />
Since a twist of fate, 'cause we're going down <br />
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
The end
