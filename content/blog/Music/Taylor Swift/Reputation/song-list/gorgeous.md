You should take it as a compliment <br />
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk <br />
You should think about the consequence <br />
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong <br />
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us <br />
He's in the club doing, I don't know what <br />
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much) <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine <br />
You've ruined my life, by not being mine <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
You're so gorgeous <br />
I can't say anything to your face <br />
'Cause look at your face <br />
And I'm so furious <br />
At you for making me feel this way <br />
But, what can I say? <br />
You're gorgeous <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-two'>
You should take it as a compliment <br />
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you) <br />
And you should think about the consequence <br />
Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room) <br />
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her <br />
But if you're single that's honestly worse <br />
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts <br />
(Honey, it hurts) <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine <br />
I feel like I might sink and drown and die <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
You're so gorgeous <br />
I can't say anything to your face (to your face) <br />
'Cause look at your face (look at your face) <br />
And I'm so furious <br />
At you for making me feel this way <br />
But what can I say? <br />
You're gorgeous <br />
</p>
<p className='bridge'>
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah <br />
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have <br />
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad <br />
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah <br />
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have  <br />
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats <br />
Alone, unless you wanna come along, oh <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
You're so gorgeous <br />
I can't say anything to your face (to your face) <br />
'Cause look at your face (look at your face) <br />
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious) <br />
At you for making me feel this way (feel this way) <br />
But what can I say? (I say) <br />
You're gorgeous <br />
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah <br />
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have <br />
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad <br />
You're gorgeous <br />
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah <br />
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have <br />
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad <br />
You're gorgeous <br />
