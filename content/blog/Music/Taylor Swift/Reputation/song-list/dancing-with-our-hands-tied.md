I, I loved you in secret <br />
First sight, yeah, we love without reason <br />
Oh, twenty-five years old <br />
Oh, how were you to know, and <br />
My, my love had been frozen <br />
Deep blue, but you painted me golden <br />
Oh, and you held me close <br />
Oh, how was I to know that <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets <br />
Picture of your face in an invisible locket <br />
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it <br />
I had a bad feeling <br />
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis <br />
People started talking, putting us through our paces <br />
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it <br />
I had a bad feeling <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
But we were dancing <br />
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Like it was the first time, first time <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
And I had a bad feeling <br />
But we were dancing <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-two'>
I, I loved you in spite of <br />
Deep fears that the world would divide us <br />
So, baby, can we dance <br />
Oh, through an avalanche? <br />
And say, say that we got it <br />
<strong className='fav-line'>
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted <br />
</strong>
Oh, 'cause it's gravity <br />
Oh, keeping you with me <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets <br />
Picture of your face in an invisible locket <br />
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
I had a bad feeling <br />
But we were dancing <br />
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Like it was the first time, first time <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
(Ooh, we had our hands tied) <br />
And I had a bad feeling <br />
But we were dancing <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I'd kiss you as the lights went out <br />
Swaying as the room burned down <br />
I'd hold you as the water rushes in <br />
If I could dance with you again <br />
I'd kiss you as the lights went out <br />
Swaying as the room burned down <br />
I'd hold you as the water rushes in <br />
If I could dance with you again <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Like it was the first time, first time <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied <br />
Yeah, we were dancing <br />
And I had a bad feeling <br />
But we were dancing <br />
Hands tied, hands tied <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
Taylor set it up by saying that inspiration for the song came when she was back in LA after spending several months out of the public eye. As we know now she spent basically all of this time in the UK with [boyfriend Joe Alwyn] without anyone knowing she was in a relationship. Back in LA […] she went to the gym only to be caught by paparazzi on her way out. The paps shouted all kinds of things at her including comments about her weight – remember this was the first time she had been properly seen in months and nobody knew she was in a relationship. She described being really overwhelmed by the experience but that her thought process was less about herself and more about how she could possibly have a normal relationship when this was her life. Taylor actually said that after the incident she went straight to the recording studio, cried, and wrote this song. - Taylor Swift
