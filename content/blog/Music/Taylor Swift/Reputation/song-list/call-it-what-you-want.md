<p className="verse-one">
My castle crumbled overnight <br />
I brought a knife to a gunfight <br />
They took the crown, but it's alright <br />
All the liars are calling me one <br />
Nobody's heard from me for months <br />
I'm doing better than I ever was, 'cause <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
My baby's fit like a daydream <br />
Walking with his head down <br />
I'm the one he's walking to <br />
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br />
My baby's fly like a jet stream <br />
High above the whole scene <br />
Loves me like I'm brand new <br />
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
All my flowers grew back as thorns <br />
Windows boarded up after the storm <br />
He built a fire just to keep me warm <br />
All the drama queens taking swings <br />
All the jokers dressin' up as kings <br />
They fade to nothing when I look at him <br />
And I know I make the same mistakes every time <br />
Bridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right <br />
I did one thing right <br />
I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers <br />
Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right <br />
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
My baby's fit like a daydream <br />
Walking with his head down <br />
I'm the one he's walking to <br />
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br />
My baby's fly like a jet stream <br />
High above the whole scene <br />
Loves me like I'm brand new <br />
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it) <br />
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br />
</p>
<p className='bridge'>
I want to wear his initial <br />
On a chain round my neck, chain round my neck <br />
Not because he owns me <br />
But 'cause he really knows me <br />
Which is more than they can say, I <br />
I recall late November, holdin' my breath <br />
<strong className='fav-line'>
Slowly I said, "You don't need to save me <br />
But would you run away with me?" <br />
</strong>
Yes (would you run away?) <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
My baby's fit like a daydream <br />
Walking with his head down <br />
I'm the one he's walking to <br />
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it) <br />
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br />
My baby's fly like a jet stream <br />
High above the whole scene <br />
Loves me like I'm brand new <br />
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it) <br />
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br />
Call it what you want, yeah <br />
Call it what you want <br />
To <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
The way I feel the album is, as far as a storyline, is I feel like it starts with just getting out any kind of rebellion, or anger, or angst, or whatever. And then, like, falling in love, and realizing that you kind of settle into what your priorities are, and your life changes, but you welcome it because it’s something that matters to you. And this last part of the album feels like settling into where I am now. So it started with where I was when I started making the album, and ends with kind of my emotional state now. And this song, I think, really reflects that probably the best on the album, and it’s called “Call It What You Want.” - Taylor Swift
