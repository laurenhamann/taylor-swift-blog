<p className='chorus'>
Don't blame me, love made me crazy <br />
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right <br />
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby <br />
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life <br />
</p> 
<p className='verse-one'>
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and <br />
Toyin' with them older guys <br />
Just playthings for me to use <br />
Something happened for the first time, in <br />
The darkest little paradise <br />
Shakin, pacin', I just need you <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
For you, I would cross the line <br />
I would waste my time <br />
I would lose my mind <br />
They say, "She's gone too far this time" <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
Don't blame me, love made me crazy <br />
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right <br />
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby <br />
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life <br />
Don't blame me, love made me crazy <br />
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right <br />
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby <br />
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life <br />
</p> 
<p className='verse-two'>
My name is whatever you decide <br />
And I'm just gonna call you mine <br />
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby) <br />
Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind <br />
Halo, hiding my obsession <br />
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
And baby, for you, I (I) would (would) fall from grace <br />
Just (just) to (to) touch your face <br />
<strong className="fav-line">
If (if) you (you) walk away <br />
I'd beg you on my knees to stay <br />
</strong>
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
Don't blame me, love made me crazy <br />
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right <br />
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby <br />
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (yeah, ooh) <br />
Don't blame me, love made me crazy <br />
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right <br />
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby <br />
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life <br />
</p>
<p className='bridge'>
I get so high, oh <br />
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me <br />
You're lovin' me <br />
Trip of my life, oh <br />
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me <br />
You're touchin' me <br />
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
Oh Lord, save me, my drug is my baby <br />
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life <br />
Usin' for the rest of my life, ohh-oh <br />
Don't blame me, love made me crazy <br />
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no) <br />
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby <br />
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (oh) <br />
Don't blame me, love made me crazy (ooh) <br />
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it right) <br />
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby <br />
I'll be usin' for (I'll be usin') the rest of my life (I'll be usin') <br />
I get so high, oh <br />
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me <br />
You're lovin' me <br />
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby <br />
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life <br />
