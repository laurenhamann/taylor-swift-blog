<p className="verse-one">
It was so nice throwing big parties <br />
Jump into the pool from the balcony <br />
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea <br />
And there are no rules when you show up here <br />
Bass beat rattling the chandelier <br />
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year <br />
So why'd you have to rain on my parade? <br />
I'm shaking my head, I'm locking the gates <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is why we can't have nice things, darling <br />
Because you break them, I had to take them away <br />
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (oh) <br />
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me? <br />
This is why we can't have nice things <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
It was so nice being friends again <br />
There I was giving you a second chance <br />
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand <br />
And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you <br />
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you <br />
And so I took an axe to a mended fence <br />
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (mmm-mmm) <br />
If only you weren't so shady <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is why we can't have nice things, darling <br />
Because you break them, I had to take them away <br />
This is why we can't have nice (nice things) things (baby), honey (oh) <br />
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me? <br />
This is why we can't have- <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Here's a toast to my real friends <br />
They don't care about the he said, she said <br />
And here's to my baby <br />
He ain't reading what they call me lately <br />
And here's to my mama <br />
Had to listen to all this drama <br />
And here's to you <br />
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do <br />
Hahaha, I can't even say it with a straight face! <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (darling) <br />
Because you break them, I had to take them away <br />
This is why we can't have nice (uh-uh) things (oh no), honey (baby, oh) <br />
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me? <br />
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (oh) <br />
And here's to my real friends <br />
(Oh) because you break them, I had to take them <br />
And here's to my baby <br />
(Oh) nice things, honey <br />
They didn't care about the he said, she said <br />
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me? <br />
This is why we can't have nice things <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
It’s about when people take nice things for granted. Like friendship, or trusting people, or being open or whatever. Letting people in on your life, trusting people, respect – those are all really nice things. - Taylor Swift
