I don't like your little games <br />
Don't like your tilted stage <br />
The role you made me play of the fool <br />
No, I don't like you <br />
I don't like your perfect crime <br />
How you laugh when you lie <br />
You said the gun was mine <br />
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!) <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time <br />
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time <br />
I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined <br />
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh! <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
Ooh, look what you made me do <br />
Look what you made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />
Look what you just made me... <br />
Ooh, look what you made me do <br />
Look what you made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-two'>
I (I) don't (don't) like your kingdom keys (keys) <br />
They (they) once belonged to me (me) <br />
You (you) asked me for a place to sleep <br />
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?) <br />
The world moves on, another day another drama, drama <br />
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma <br />
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure <br />
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (nick of time) <br />
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time ( <br />I do it all the time) <br />
I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined <br />
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh! <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
Ooh, look what you made me do <br />
Look what you made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />
Look what you just made me... <br />
Ooh, look what you made me do <br />
Look what you made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />
</p>
<p className='bridge'>
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me <br />
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams <br />
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me <br />
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams <br />
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me <br />
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams <br />
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me <br />
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams <br />
I'm sorry <br />
But the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now <br />
Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead (oh) <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
Ooh, look what you made me do <br />
Look what you made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />
Look what you just made me... <br />
Ooh, look what you made me do <br />
Look what you made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />
Ooh, look what you made me do <br />
Look what you made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />
Look what you just made me... <br />
Ooh, look what you made me do <br />
Look what you made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />
Look what you just made me do <br />

## Quote from artist

<blockquote>
[When we wrote the song] she came over to my house. We hung out and wrote the song. […] We just, were kinda, like, messing around and cooked up all these different ideas together. I love working with people, and I’m blessed to work with people who are always moving forward. - Jack Antonoff
