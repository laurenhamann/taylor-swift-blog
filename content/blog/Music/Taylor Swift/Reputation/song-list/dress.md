Our secret moments in your crowded room <br />
They've got no idea about me and you <br />
There is an indentation in the shape of you <br />
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation <br />
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah) <br />
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting <br />
My hands are shaking from holding back from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha) <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
Say my name and everything just stops <br />
I don't want you like a best friend <br />
Only bought this dress so you could take it off <br />
Take it off (ha, ha, ha) <br />
Carve your name into my bedpost <br />
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend <br />
Only bought this dress so you could take it off <br />
Take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha) <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-two'>
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try <br />
<strong className="fav-line">
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified <br />
</strong>
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub, you kiss my face and we're both drunk <br />
Everyone thinks that they know us, but they know nothing about <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation <br />
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah) <br />
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting <br />
My hands are shaking from holding back from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha) <br />
Say my name and everything just stops <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
I don't want you like a best friend <br />
Only bought this dress so you could take it off <br />
Take it off (ha, ha, ha) <br />
Carve your name into my bedpost <br />
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend <br />
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha) <br />
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha) <br />
Only bought this dress so you could take it off <br />
</p>
<p className='bridge'>
Flashback when you met me <br />
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached <br />
Even in my worst times, you could see the best of me <br />
Flashback to my mistakes <br />
My rebounds, my earthquakes <br />
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth of me <br />
And I woke up just in time <br />
Now I wake up by your side <br />
My one and only, my lifeline <br />
I woke up just in time <br />
Now I wake up by your side <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
My hands shake, I can't explain this (ha, ha, ha, ha) <br />
Say my name and everything just stops <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
I don't want you like a best friend <br />
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha) <br />
Carve your name into my bedpost <br />
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend <br />
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha) <br />
</p>
<p className='outro'>
There is an indentation <br />
In the shape of you <br />
Only bought this dress so you could take it off <br />
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo <br />
Only bought this dress so you could take it off <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
This song was one of those things where almost every line is something that I came up with like a year before, and then when I was writing the song, I just cherry picked, and I was like, ‘Like that, like that, like that, like that.’ And I was really proud of the hook of this because it sounds like a pickup line, and yet it is a love song about deep and tender feelings. - Taylor Swift
