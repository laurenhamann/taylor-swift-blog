<p className="pre-chorus">
This ain't for the best <br />
My reputation's never been worse, so <br />
You must like me for me <br />
We can't make any promises <br />
Now can we, babe? <br />
But you can make me a drink <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at? <br />
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black <br />
Come here; you can meet me in the back <br />
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you <br />
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue <br />
Just think of the fun things we could do <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause I like you <br />
This ain't for the best <br />
My reputation's never been worse, so <br />
You must like me for me <br />
Yeah, I want you <br />
We can't make any promises <br />
Now can we, babe? <br />
But you can make me a drink <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Is it cool that I said all that? <br />
Is it chill that you're in my head? <br />
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate) <br />
Is it cool that I said all that? <br />
Is it too soon to do this yet? <br />
'Cause I know that it's delicate <br />
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it? <br />
Isn't it? <br />
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it? <br />
Isn't it delicate? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Third floor on the West Side, me and you <br />
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view <br />
Do the girls back home touch you like I do? <br />
Long night with your hands up in my hair <br />
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs <br />
Stay here, honey, I don't want to share <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause I like you <br />
This ain't for the best <br />
My reputation's never been worse, so  <br />
You must like me for me <br />
Yeah, I want you <br />
We can't make any promises <br />
Now can we, babe? <br />
But you can make me a drink <br />

Is it cool that I said all that? <br />
Is it too soon to do this yet? <br />
'Cause I know that it's delicate <br />
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it? <br />
Isn't it? <br />
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it? <br />
Isn't it delicate? <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Sometimes I wonder; when you sleep <br />
Are you ever dreaming of me? <br />
Sometimes when I look into your eyes <br />
<strong className='fav-line'>
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time <br />

'Cause I like you <br />
Is it cool that I said all that? <br />
Is it chill that you're in my head? <br />
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate) <br />
Yeah, I want you <br />

## Quote from artist

<blockquote>
So this is a song called ‘Delicate.’ There is like an effect that you may hear on the vocals throughout the rest of the album that is recurring and it’s a vocoder. And um, what is that you say? It’s a vocal effect where you sing and the vocoder splits your voice into chords and you can play your voice on a keyboard in chords. So basically, if you’re singing the notes of a piano and you could play your own voice. So that’s what you’ll hear in the beginning and throughout this song and then you’ll hear it several times – we tried it in the studio and I thought it sounded really emotional and really vulnerable and really kind of like sad but beautiful. This is a song that like, the idea of your reputation is, um, is definitely something that I play on for the entire album but when the album starts off it’s much more bombastic, it’s more like, ‘Oh, I don’t care about what you say about me, I don’t care what say about my reputation, it doesn’t matter, Blah!’ But, like, then it hits this point on track 5 where it’s like… oh god, what happens when you meet someone who you really want in your life and then you start worrying about what they’ve heard before they met you? You start to wonder like, ‘Could something fake, like your reputation, affect something real, like someone getting to know you?’ And you start to wonder, um, how much does all that matter? And this is the first point of vulnerability in the record where you’re like, ‘Oh, maybe this does actually matter a little bit.’ Um, and how does that factor in? Kind of questioning the reality and the perception of a reputation what that actually… how much weight it actually has. So this is called ‘Delicate.’ - Taylor Swift
