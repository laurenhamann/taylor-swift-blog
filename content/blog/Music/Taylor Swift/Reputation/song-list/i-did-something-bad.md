<p className="verse-one">
I never trust a narcissist <br />
But they love me <br />
So I play 'em like a violin <br />
And I make it look oh so easy <br />
'Cause for every lie I tell them <br />
They tell me three <br />
This is how the world works <br />
Now all he thinks about is me <br />
I can feel the flames on my skin <br />
Crimson red paint on my lips <br />
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing <br />
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
They say I did something bad <br />
Then why's it feel so good? <br />
They say I did something bad <br />
But why's it feel so good? <br />
Most fun I ever had <br />
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could <br />
It just felt so good, good <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I never trust a playboy <br />
But they love me <br />
So I fly him all around the world <br />
And I let them think they saved me <br />
They never see it comin' <br />
What I do next <br />
This is how the world works <br />
You gotta leave before you get left <br />
I can feel the flames on my skin <br />
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing" <br />
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin' <br />
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin' <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
They say I did something bad <br />
Then why's it feel so good? <br />
They say I did something bad <br />
But why's it feel so good? <br />
Most fun I ever had <br />
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could <br />
It just felt so good, good <br />
It just felt so good <br />
</p>
<p className='bridge'>
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one <br />
They got their pitchforks and proof <br />
Their receipts and reasons <br />
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one <br />
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up) <br />
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up) <br />
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up) <br />
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up) <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
They say I did something bad <br />
Then why's it feel so good? <br />
They say I did something bad <br />
But why's it feel so good? <br />
Most fun I ever had <br />
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could <br />
It just felt so good, good <br />
Oh, you say I did something bad <br />
Then why's it feel so good, good? <br />
So bad, why's it feel so good? <br />
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad) <br />
It just felt so good, good <br />
</p>

## Quote from artist

<blockquote>
This song is called ‘I Did Something Bad,’ and I wrote this song on piano, it’s not gonna sound like it though. […] So I brought it into them and I was trying to explain the production. I had had a weird dream and I’d woken up with this – you’re like ‘here we go again.’ I’d woken up with this sound in my head that was like this, like, it was a sound that was so hook-y and so catchy that I knew it would have to be in a song because it was that annoying. It wouldn’t stop going around in my head, and the sound was [makes noise imitating post-chorus]. Like, ‘after the chorus that’s what I want to hear, but I don’t want it to be my voice, I want it to be an instrument. What instrument is that?’ I was, like, playing the voice memo to Max [Martin] and he’s like, ‘oh, there’s not an instrument that can do that, but what we can do is we can take your voice doing it and pitch it down so that it sounds like an enchantress, slash a dude. So that’s what you hear after the chorus. But, um, anyway. This is called 'I Did Something Bad,’ and this is when we first kinda knew we might be onto something with the album. - Taylor Swift
