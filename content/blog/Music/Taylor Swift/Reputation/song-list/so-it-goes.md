<p className='verse-one'>
See you in the dark <br />
All eyes on you, my magician <br />
All eyes on us <br />
You make everyone disappear, and <br />
Cut me into pieces <br />
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings <br />
Back against the wall <br />
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
'Cause we breakdown a little <br />
But when you get me alone, it's so simple <br />
'Cause baby, I know what you know <br />
We can feel it <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
And all the pieces fall <br />
Right into place <br />
Getting caught up in a moment <br />
Lipstick on your face <br />
So it goes <br />
I'm yours to keep <br />
And I'm yours to lose <br />
You know I'm not a bad girl <br />
But I do bad things with you <br />
So it goes <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-two'>
Met you in a bar <br />
All eyes on me, your illusionist <br />
All eyes on us <br />
I make all your gray days clear and <br />
Wear you like a necklace <br />
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous <br />
But I got your heart <br />
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
'Cause we breakdown a little <br />
But when I get you alone, it's so simple <br />
'Cause baby, I know what you know <br />
We can feel it <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
And all the pieces fall <br />
Right into place <br />
Getting caught up in a moment <br />
Lipstick on your face <br />
So it goes <br />
I'm yours to keep <br />
And I'm yours to lose <br />
You know I'm not a bad girl <br />
But I do bad things with you <br />
So it goes <br />
</p>
<p className='bridge'>
Come here, dressed in black now <br />
So, so, so it goes <br />
Scratches down your back now <br />
So, so, so it goes <br />
You did a number on me <br />
But honestly, baby, who's counting? <br />
I did a number on you <br />
But honestly, baby, who's counting? <br />
You did a number on me <br />
But honestly, baby, who's counting? <br />
Who's counting? <br />
(One, two, three) <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
And all the pieces fall <br />
Right into place <br />
Getting caught up in a moment <br />
Lipstick on your face <br />
So it goes <br />
I'm yours to keep <br />
And I'm yours to lose <br />
You know I'm not a bad girl <br />
But I do bad things with you <br />
So it goes <br />
</p>
<p className='outro'>
Come here, dressed in black now <br />
So, so, so it goes <br />
Scratches down your back now <br />
So, so, so it goes <br />
Come here, dressed in black now <br />
So, so, so it goes <br />
Scratches down your back now <br />
So, so, so it goes <br />
</p>
