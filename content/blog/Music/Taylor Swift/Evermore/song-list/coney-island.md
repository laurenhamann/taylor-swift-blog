<p className="verse-one">
Break my soul in two <br />
Looking for you but you're right here <br />
If I can't relate to you anymore <br />
Then who am I related to? <br />
And if this is the long haul <br />
How'd we get here so soon? <br />
Did I close my fist around something delicate? <br />
Did I shatter you? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go? <br />
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go <br />
Sorry for not making you my centerfold <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Over and over <br />
Lost again with no surprises <br />
Disappointments, close your eyes <br />
And it gets colder and colder <br />
When the sun goes down <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
The question pounds my head <br />
"What's a lifetime of achievement?" <br />
If I pushed you to the edge <br />
But you were too polite to leave me <br />
And do you miss the rogue <br />
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there? <br />
Will you forgive my soul <br />
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause we were like the mall before the Internet <br />
It was the one place to be <br />
The mischief, the gift wrapped suburban dreams <br />
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Over and over <br />
Lost again with no surprises <br />
Disappointments, close your eyes <br />
And it gets colder and colder <br />
When the sun goes down <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Were you waiting at our old spot <br />
In the tree line by the gold clock <br />
Did I leave you hanging every single day? <br />
Were you standing in the hallway <br />
With a big cake, happy birthday <br />
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray? <br />
A universe away <br />
And when I got into the accident <br />
The sight that flashed before me was your face <br />
But when I walked up to the podium <br />
I think that I forgot to say your name <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I'm on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go? <br />
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go <br />
Sorry for not making you my centerfold <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Over and over <br />
Lost again with no surprises <br />
Disappointments, close your eyes <br />
And it gets colder and colder <br />
When the sun goes down <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
When the sun goes down <br />
The sight that flashed before me was your face <br />
When the sun goes down <br />
But I think that I forgot to say your name <br />
Over and over <br />
Sorry for not making you my <br />
Making you my <br />
Making you my centerfold <br />
</p>



<blockquote>
I had been working on a bunch of music with my brother [Bryce Dessner], some of which we were sending to Taylor also. At that stage, ‘coney island’ was all the music except the drums. And as I was writing it, I don’t think I was ever thinking, ‘This sounds like The National or this sounds like Big Red Machine or this sounds like something totally different.’ But Taylor and [Joe Alwyn] wrote this incredible song, and we first recorded it with just her vocals. It has this really beautiful arc to the story, and I think it’s one of the strongest, lyrically and musically. But listening to the words, we all collectively realized that this does feel like the most related to the National — it almost feels like a story Matt [Berninger] might tell, or I could hear Bryan [Devendorf] playing the drum part.

So we started talking about how it would be cool to get the band, and I called Matt and he was excited for it. We got Bryan to play drums and we got Scott [Devendorf] to play bass and a pocket piano, and Bryce helped produce it. It’s weird, because it does really feel like Taylor, obviously, since she and [Joe Alwyn] wrote all the words, but it also feels like a National song in a good way. I love how Matt and Taylor sound together. - Taylor Swift
