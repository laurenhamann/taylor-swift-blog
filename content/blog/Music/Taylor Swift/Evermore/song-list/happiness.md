<p className="verse-one">
Honey, when I'm above the trees <br />
I see this for what it is <br />
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given <br />
Is just shit we're dividin' up <br />
Showed you all of my hiding spots <br />
I was dancing when the music stopped <br />
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention <br />
I haven't met the new me yet <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
There'll be happiness after you <br />
But there was happiness because of you <br />
Both of these things can be true <br />
There is happiness <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Past the blood and bruise <br />
Past the curses and cries <br />
Beyond the terror in the nightfall <br />
Haunted by the look in my eyes <br />
That would've loved you for a lifetime <br />
Leave it all behind <br />
And there is happiness <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Tell me, when did your winning smile <br />
Begin to look like a smirk? <br />
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons <br />
Pointed at my deepest hurt? <br />
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool <br />
Who takes my spot next to you <br />
No, I didn't mean that <br />
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury <br />
You haven't met the new me yet <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
There'll be happiness after me <br />
But there was happiness because of me <br />
Both of these things, I believe <br />
There is happiness <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
In our history, across our great divide <br />
There is a glorious sunrise <br />
Dappled with the flickers of light <br />
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind <br />
And there is happiness <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I can't make it go away by making you a villain <br />
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven <br />
And I pulled your body into mine <br />
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties <br />
No one teaches you what to do <br />
When a good man hurts you <br />
And you know you hurt him, too <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Honey, when I'm above the trees <br />
I see it for what it is <br />
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head <br />
After giving you the best I had <br />
Tell me what to give after that <br />
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness <br />
You haven't met the new me yet <br />
And I think she'll give you that <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
There'll be happiness after you <br />
But there was happiness because of you, too <br />
Both of these things can be true <br />
There is happiness <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
In our history, across our great divide <br />
There is a glorious sunrise <br />
Dappled with the flickers of light <br />
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind <br />
Oh, leave it all behind <br />
Leave it all behind <br />
And there is happiness <br />
</p>
