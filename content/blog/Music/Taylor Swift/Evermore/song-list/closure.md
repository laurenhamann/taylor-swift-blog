<p className="verse-one">
It's been a long time <br />
And seeing the shape of your name <br />
Still spells out pain <br />
It wasn't right <br />
The way it all went down <br />
Looks like you know that now <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Yes, I got your letter <br />
Yes, I'm doing better <br />
It cut deep to know ya <br />
Right to the bone <br />
Yes, I got your letter <br />
Yes, I'm doing better <br />
I know that it's over <br />
I don't need your closure <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Your closure <br />
Don't treat me like some situation that needs to be handled <br />
I'm fine with my spite <br />
And my tears <br />
And my beers and my candles <br />
I can feel you smoothing me over <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Yes, I got your letter <br />
Yes, I'm doing better <br />
It cut deep to know ya <br />
Right to the bone <br />
Yes, I got your letter <br />
Yes, I'm doing better <br />
I know that it's over <br />
I don't need your closure <br />
Your closure <br />
Your closure <br />
Your closure <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I know I'm just a <br />
Wrinkle in your new life <br />
Staying friends <br />
Would iron it out so nice <br />
Guilty, guilty reaching out across the sea <br />
That you put between you and me <br />
But it's fake <br />
And it's oh so unnecessary <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Yes, I got your letter <br />
Yes, I'm doing better <br />
It cut deep to know ya <br />
Right to the bone <br />
Yes, I got your letter <br />
Yes, I'm doing better <br />
I know that it's over <br />
I don't need your closure, closure <br />
Your closure <br />
Your closure <br />
</p>

I went to see Justin [Vernon] at one point — that’s the one trip I’ve made — and we worked together at his place on stuff. He plays the drums on ‘cowboy like me’ and ‘closure,’ and he plays guitar and banjo and sings on ‘ivy,’ and sings on ‘marjorie’ and ‘evermore.’ And then we processed Taylor’s vocals [on ‘closure’] through his Messina chain together. He was really deeply involved in this record, even more so than the last record. - Aaron Dessner
