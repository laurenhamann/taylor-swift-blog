<p className="verse-one">
You booked the night train for a reason <br />          
So you could sit there in this hurt <br />  
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers <br />  
You're not sure which is worse <br />  
Because I dropped your hand while dancing <br />  
Left you out there standing <br />  
Crestfallen on the landing <br />  
Champagne problems <br />  
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Your mom's ring in your pocket <br />  
My picture in your wallet <br />  
Your heart was glass, I dropped it <br />  
Champagne problems <br />  
You told your family for a reason <br />  
You couldn't keep it in <br />  
Your sister splashed out on the bottle <br />  
Now no one's celebrating <br />  
Dom Pérignon, you brought it <br />  
No crowd of friends applauded <br />  
Your hometown skeptics called it <br />  
Champagne problems <br />  
You had a speech, you're speechless <br />  
Love slipped beyond your reaches <br />  
And I couldn't give a reason <br />  
Champagne problems <br />  
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door <br />  
November flush and your flannel cure <br />  
"This dorm was once a madhouse" <br />  
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me" <br />  
How evergreen, our group of friends <br />  
Don't think we'll say that word again <br />  
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls <br />  
That we once walked through <br />  
One for the money, two for the show <br />  
I never was ready, so I watch you go <br />  
Sometimes you just don't know the answer <br />  
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you <br />  
"She would've made such a lovely bride <br />  
What a shame she's fucked in the head, " they said <br />  
But you'll find the real thing instead <br />  
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred <br />  
</p>
<p className="outro">
And hold your hand while dancing <br />  
Never leave you standing <br />  
Crestfallen on the landing <br />  
With champagne problems <br />  
Your mom's ring in your pocket <br />  
Her picture in your wallet <br />  
You won't remember all my <br />  
Champagne problems <br />  
You won't remember all my <br />  
Champagne problems <br />  
</p>


## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQacWbsLbS4">
Well, Joe and I really love sad songs, we’ve always bonded over music. He started that one and came up with the melodic structure of it. I’d say it was a surprise that we started writing together but, in a way, it wasn’t, ‘cause we have always bonded over music and have the same musical taste, and he’s always the person who’s showing me songs by artists, and then they become my favourite songs or whatever. [The “champagne problems” bridge] was one of my favourites to write, I really love a bridge where you tell the full story in a bridge, you really shift gears in that bridge. I’m so excited to, one day, be in front of a crowd when they all sing, 'She would’ve made such a lovely bride, what a shame she’s fucked in the head.’ I know it’s so sad, but it’s those songs like “All Too Well” where performing that song is one of the most joyful experiences I ever go through so, when there’s a song like “champagne problems” where you know it’s so sad, but… I love a sad song, y'know? - Taylor Swift
