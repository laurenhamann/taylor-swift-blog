<p className="verse-one">
Friends break up, friends get married <br />
Strangers get born, strangers get buried <br />
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies <br />
But I'm right where you left me <br />
Matches burn after the other <br />
Pages turn and stick to each other <br />
Wages earned and lessons learned <br />
But I, I'm right where you left me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Help, I'm still at the restaurant <br />
Still sitting in a corner I haunt <br />
Cross-legged in the dim light <br />
They say, "What a sad sight" <br />
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop <br />
Right when I felt the moment stop <br />
Glass shattered on the white cloth <br />
Everybody moved on <br />
I, I stayed there <br />
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair <br />
They expected me to find somewhere <br />
Some perspective, but I sat and stared <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Right where you left me <br />
You left me no, oh, you left me no <br />
You left me no choice but to stay here forever <br />
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no <br />
You left me no choice but to stay here forever <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen? <br />
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it <br />
She's still 23 inside her fantasy <br />
How it was supposed to be <br />
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion? <br />
Break-ups happen every day, you don't have to lose it <br />
She's still 23 inside her fantasy <br />
And you're sitting in front of me <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
At the restaurant, when I was still the one you want <br />
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right <br />
I, I could feel the mascara run <br />
You told me that you met someone <br />
Glass shattered on the white cloth <br />
Everybody moved on <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Help, I'm still at the restaurant <br />
Still sitting in a corner I haunt <br />
Cross-legged in the dim light <br />
They say, "What a sad sight" <br />
I, I stayed there <br />
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair <br />
I'm sure that you got a wife out there <br />
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware <br />
'Cause I'm right where <br />
I cause no harm, mind my business <br />
If our love died young, I can't bear witness <br />
And it's been so long <br />
But if you ever think you got it wrong <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm right where you left me <br />
You left me no, oh, you left me no <br />
You left me no choice but to stay here forever <br />
You left me <br />
You left me no, oh, you left me no <br />
You left me no choice but to stay here forever <br />
</p>
