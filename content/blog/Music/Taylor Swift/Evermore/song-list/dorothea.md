<p className="verse-one">
Hey Dorothea <br />
Do you ever stop and think about me? <br />
When we were younger <br />
Down in the park <br />
Honey, making a lark of the misery <br />
You got shiny friends since you left town <br />
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now <br />
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Ooh <br />
This place is the same as it ever was <br />
Ooh <br />
But you don't like it that way <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's never too late <br />
To come back to my side <br />
The stars in your eyes <br />
Shined brighter in Tupelo <br />
And if you're ever tired of being known <br />
For who you know <br />
You know, you'll always know me <br />
Dorothea (ah-ah) <br />
Dorothea (ah-ah) <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Ooh, you're a queen <br />
Selling dreams <br />
Selling make up and magazines <br />
Ooh, from you I'd buy anything <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Hey Dorothea <br />
Do you ever stop and think about me? <br />
When it was calmer <br />
Skipping the prom <br />
Just to piss off your mom <br />
And her pageant schemes <br />
And damn, Dorothea <br />
They all wanna be ya <br />
But are you still the same soul <br />
I met under the bleachers? <br />
Well <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Ooh <br />
I guess I'll never know <br />
Ooh <br />
And you'll go on with the show <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But it's never too late <br />
To come back to my side <br />
The stars in your eyes <br />
Shined brighter in Tupelo <br />
And if you're ever tired of being known <br />
For who you know <br />
You know, you'll always know me <br />
Dorothea (ah-ah) <br />
Dorothea (ah-ah) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Ooh <br />
Ooh <br />
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh <br />
Ooh <br />
Ooh <br />
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh <br />
Dorothea (ah-ah) <br />
