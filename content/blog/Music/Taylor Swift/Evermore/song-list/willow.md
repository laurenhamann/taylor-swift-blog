<p className="verse-one">
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night <br />
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife <br />
And if it was an open-shut case <br />
I never would've known from that look on your face <br />
Lost in your current like a priceless wine <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
The more that you say <br />
The less I know <br />
Wherever you stray <br />
I follow <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh) <br />
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in <br />
As if you were a mythical thing <br />
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring <br />
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
The more that you say <br />
The less I know <br />
Wherever you stray <br />
I follow <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
You know that my train could take you home <br />
Anywhere else is hollow <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh) <br />
They count me out time and time again <br />
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh) <br />
But I come back stronger than a 90's trend <br />
Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark <br />
Show me the places where the others gave you scars <br />
Now this is an open-shut case <br />
Guess I should've known from the look on your face <br />
Every bait and switch was a work of art <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
The more that you say <br />
The less I know <br />
Wherever you stray <br />
I follow <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
You know that my train could take you home <br />
Anywhere else is hollow <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
The more that you say <br />
The less I know <br />
Wherever you stray <br />
I follow <br />
Begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
You know that my train could take you home <br />
Anywhere else is hollow <br />
Begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
Hey, that's my man <br />
That's my man <br />
Yeah, that's my man <br />
Every bait and switch was a work of art <br />
That's my man <br />
Hey, that's my man <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
‘willow’ is about intrigue, desire, and the complexity that goes into wanting someone. I think it sounds like casting a spell to make somebody fall in love with you (an oddly specific visual) - Taylor Swift
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I liked opening the album with that because I loved the feeling that I got immediately upon hearing the instrumental that Aaron created for it. It felt strangely witchy, it felt like somebody standing over a potion making a love potion, dreaming up the person that they want and the person they desire, and trying to figure out how to get that person on their life, and all the kind of misdirection, baint-and-switch and complexity that goes into seeing someone, feeling a conexion, wanting them, and trying to make them a part of your life. It’s tactical at times, it’s confusing at times, it’s up to fate, it’s magical and it’s weird. It felt a bit magical and mysterious, which is what I wanted people to feel going into an album that was a collection of these stories that were going to take them in all kinds of directions, so I wanted to start them with sort of a setting of the vibe. Also, one of the main themes throughout folklore was conflict resolution, trying to figure out how to get through something with someone, or making confessions, or trying to tell them something, trying to communicate with them. evermore deals a lot in endings of all sorts, shapes and sizes, all the kinds of ways we can end a relationship, a friendship, something toxic, and the pain that goes along with that and the phases of it. - Taylor Swift
