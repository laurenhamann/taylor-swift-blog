<p className="verse-one">
How's one to know? <br />
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones <br />
In a faith-forgotten land <br />
In from the snow <br />
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow <br />
Tarnished, but so grand <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And the old widow goes to the stone every day <br />
But I don't, I just sit here and wait <br />
Grieving for the living <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, goddamn <br />
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand <br />
Taking mine but it's been promised to another <br />
Oh, I can't <br />
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland <br />
My house of stone, your ivy grows <br />
And now I'm covered in you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I wish to know <br />
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be <br />
Magnificently cursed <br />
He's in the room <br />
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see <br />
He wants what's only yours <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, goddamn <br />
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand <br />
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another <br />
Oh, I can't <br />
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland <br />
My house of stone, your ivy grows <br />
And now I'm covered <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Clover blooms in the fields <br />
Spring breaks loose, the time is near <br />
What would he do if he found us out? <br />
Crescent moon, coast is clear <br />
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear <br />
He's gonna burn this house to the ground <br />
How's one to know? <br />
I'd live and die for moments that we stole <br />
On begged and borrowed time <br />
So tell me to run <br />
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become <br />
And drink my husband's wine <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, goddamn <br />
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand <br />
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another <br />
Oh, I can't <br />
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland <br />
My house of stone, your ivy grows <br />
And now I'm covered in you <br />
And I'm covered in you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
So yeah, it's a fire <br />
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark <br />
And you started it <br />
You started it <br />
So yeah, it's a war <br />
It's the goddamn fight of my life <br />
And you started it <br />
You started it <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, I can't <br />
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland <br />
My house of stone, your ivy grows <br />
And now I'm covered in you <br />
In you <br />
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br />
Now I'm covered in you <br />
In you <br />
</p>
