<p className="verse-one">
I sit and watch you reading with your head low <br />
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed <br />
I sit and watch you, I notice everything you do or don't do <br />
You're so much older and wiser and I <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid <br />
Use my best colors for your portrait <br />
Lay the table with the fancy shit <br />
And watch you tolerate it <br />
If it's all in my head tell me now <br />
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow <br />
I know my love should be celebrated <br />
But you tolerate it <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome <br />
I take your indiscretions all in good fun <br />
I sit and listen, I polish plates until they gleam and glisten <br />
You're so much older and wiser and I <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid <br />
Use my best colors for your portrait <br />
Lay the table with the fancy shit <br />
And watch you tolerate it <br />
If it's all in my head tell me now <br />
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow <br />
I know my love should be celebrated <br />
But you tolerate it <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
While you were out building other worlds, where was I? <br />
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire? <br />
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky <br />
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life <br />
Drawing hearts in the byline <br />
Always taking up too much space or time <br />
You assume I'm fine <br />
But what would you do if I <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Break free and leave us in ruins <br />
Took this dagger in me and removed it <br />
Gain the weight of you then lose it <br />
Believe me, I could do it <br />
If it's all in my head tell me now <br />
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow <br />
I know my love should be celebrated <br />
But you tolerate it <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I sit and watch you <br />
</p>



## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I decided on track five because of the lyrics of ‘tolerate it’ and how it’s so visual, and conveys such a specific kind of hurt. - Taylor Swift

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQacWbsLbS4">
When I was reading Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier and I was thinking, ‘Wow, her husband just tolerates her. She’s doing all these things and she’s trying so hard and she’s trying to impress him, and he’s just tolerating her the whole time.’ There was a part of me that was relating to that, because at some point in my life, I felt that way. So, I ended up writing this song “tolerate it”, that’s all about sort of trying to love someone who’s ambivalent. - Taylor Swift
