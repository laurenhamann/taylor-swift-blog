<p className="intro">
Gleaming, twinkling <br />
Eyes like sinking ships on waters <br />
So inviting, I almost jump in <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush <br />
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush <br />
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch <br />
Everybody wants you <br />
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you <br />
Walk past, quick brush <br />
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush <br />
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush <br />
Everybody wants you <br />
But I don't like a gold rush <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful? <br />
With your hair falling into place like dominoes <br />
I see me padding across your wooden floors <br />
With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit <br />
And the coastal town we wandered 'round <br />
Had nevеr seen a love as pure as it <br />
And then it fadеs into the gray of my day-old tea <br />
'Cause it could never be <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush <br />
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush <br />
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch <br />
Everybody wants you <br />
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you <br />
Walk past, quick brush <br />
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush <br />
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush <br />
Everybody wants you <br />
But I don't like a gold rush <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful? <br />
With your hair falling into place like dominoes <br />
My mind turns your life into folklore <br />
I can't dare to dream about you anymore <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
At dinner parties, I won't call you out on your contrarian shit <br />
And the coastal town we never found <br />
Will never see a love as pure as it <br />
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea <br />
'Cause it will never be <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Gleaming, twinkling <br />
Eyes like sinking ships on waters <br />
So inviting, I almost jump in <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
Jack’s favorite is ‘gold rush.’ Which takes place inside a single daydream where you get lost in thought for a minute and then snap out of it. - Taylor Swift
