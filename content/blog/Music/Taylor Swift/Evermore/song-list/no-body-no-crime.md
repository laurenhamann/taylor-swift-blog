<p className="intro">
He did it <br />
He did it <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Este's a friend of mine <br />
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine <br />
Este's been losing sleep <br />
Her husband's acting different and it smells like infidelity <br />
She says, "That ain't my merlot on his mouth" <br />
"That ain't my jewelry on our joint account" <br />
No, there ain't no doubt <br />
I think I'm gonna call him out <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
She says <br />
"I think he did it but I just can't prove it" <br />
I think he did it but I just can't prove it <br />
I think he did it but I just can't prove it <br />
No, no body, no crime <br />
But I ain't letting up until the day I die <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
No, no <br />
I think he did it <br />
No, no <br />
He did it <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Este wasn't there <br />
Tuesday night at Olive Garden, at her job, or anywhere <br />
He reports his missing wife <br />
And I noticed when I passed his house his truck has got some brand new tires <br />
And his mistress moved in <br />
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything <br />
No, there ain't no doubt <br />
Somebody's gotta catch him out <br />
'Cause <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I think he did it but I just can't prove it (he did it) <br />
I think he did it but I just can't prove it (he did it) <br />
I think he did it but I just can't prove it <br />
No, no body, no crime <br />
But I ain't letting up until the day I die <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
No, no <br />
I think he did it <br />
No, no <br />
He did it <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen <br />
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene <br />
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me ("She was with me dude") <br />
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
They think she did it but they just can't prove it <br />
They think she did it but they just can't prove it <br />
She thinks I did it but she just can't prove it <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
No, no body, no crime <br />
I wasn't letting up until the day he <br />
No, no body, no crime <br />
I wasn't letting up until the day he <br />
No, no body, no crime <br />
I wasn't letting up until the day he died <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
The Haim sisters have been my best friends for years and weâ€™ve played together so many times but this is the first time weâ€™ve done a song together. [â€¦] I wrote â€˜No body, no crimeâ€™ by myself. It was inspired by my obsession with true crime podcasts/documentaries and I used one of my best friendsâ€™ names as the main character ðŸ˜‚ - Taylor Swift
