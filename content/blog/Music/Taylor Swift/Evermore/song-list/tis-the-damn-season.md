<p className="verse-one">
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with <br />
While I was gone I would have asked you <br />
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass <br />
But I felt it when I passed you <br />
There's an ache in you put there by the ache in me <br />
But if it's all the same to you <br />
It's the same to me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So we could call it even <br />
You could call me babe for the weekend <br />
'Tis the damn season, write this down <br />
I'm stayin' at my parents' house <br />
And the road not taken looks real good now <br />
And it always leads to you in my hometown <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist <br />
And thе school that used to be ours <br />
The holidays linger like bad perfume <br />
You can run, but only so far <br />
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave <br />
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We could call it even <br />
You could call me babe for the weekend <br />
'Tis the damn season, write this down <br />
I'm stayin' at my parents' house <br />
And the road not taken looks real good now <br />
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires <br />
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out <br />
We could just ride around <br />
And the road not taken looks real good now <br />
And it always leads to you in my hometown <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake <br />
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay <br />
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends <br />
Who'll write books about me, if I ever make it <br />
And wonder about the only soul who can tell which smiles I'm fakin' <br />
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own <br />
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known <br />
We could call it even <br />
Even though I'm leavin' <br />
And I'll be yours for the weekend <br />
'Tis the damn season <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We could call it even <br />
You could call me babe for the weekend <br />
'Tis the damn season, write this down <br />
I'm stayin' at my parents' house <br />
And the road not taken looks real good now <br />
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires <br />
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out <br />
We could just ride around <br />
And the road not taken looks real good now <br />
And it always leads to you in my hometown <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
It always leads to you in my hometown <br />
