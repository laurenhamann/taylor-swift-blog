<p className="verse-one">
And the tennis court was covered up <br />
With some tent-like thing <br />
And you asked me to dance <br />
But I said, "Dancing is a dangerous game" <br />
Oh, I thought <br />
This is gonna be one of those things <br />
Now I know <br />
I'm never gonna love again <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
I've got some tricks up my sleeve <br />
Takes one to know one <br />
You're a cowboy like me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Never wanted love <br />
Just a fancy car <br />
Now I'm waiting by the phone <br />
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
You had some tricks up your sleeve <br />
Takes one to know one <br />
You're a cowboy like me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Perched in the dark <br />
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear <br />
Like it could be love <br />
I could be the way forward <br />
Only if they pay for it <br />
You're a bandit like me <br />
Eyes full of stars <br />
Hustling for the good life <br />
Never thought I'd meet you here <br />
It could be love <br />
We could be the way forward <br />
And I know I'll pay for it <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You're a cowboy like me <br />
Perched in the dark <br />
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear <br />
Like it could be love <br />
I could be the way forward <br />
Only if they pay for it <br />
You're a bandit like me <br />
Eyes full of stars <br />
Hustling for the good life <br />
Never thought I'd meet you here <br />
It could be love <br />
We could be the way forward <br />
And I know I'll pay for it <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And the skeletons in both our closets <br />
Plotted hard to fuck this up <br />
And the old men that I've swindled <br />
Really did believe I was the one <br />
And the ladies lunching have their stories about <br />
When you passed through town <br />
But with that, it was all before I locked it down <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Now you hang from my lips <br />
Like the Gardens of Babylon <br />
With your boots beneath my bed <br />
Forever is the sweetest con <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
I had some tricks up my sleeve <br />
Takes one to know one <br />
You're a cowboy like me <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
And I'm never gonna love again <br />
I'm never gonna love again <br />
I'm never gonna love again <br />
</p>
