<p className="verse-one">
The drought was the very worst, ah ah <br />
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst <br />
It was months, and months of back and forth, ah ah <br />
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Hung my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning <br />
That's when I could finally breathe <br />
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
There was nothing left to do, ah ah <br />
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room <br />
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah <br />
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning <br />
That's when I could finally breathe <br />
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean <br />
I think I am finally clean, ah <br />
Said, I think I am finally clean, ah <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Ten months sober, I must admit <br />
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it <br />
Ten months older I won't give in <br />
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
The drought was the very worst, ah ah <br />
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning <br />
That's when I could finally breathe <br />
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean <br />
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning <br />
That's when I could finally breathe <br />
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Finally clean, think I'm finally clean, ah ah <br />
Think I'm finally clean <br />
</p>
