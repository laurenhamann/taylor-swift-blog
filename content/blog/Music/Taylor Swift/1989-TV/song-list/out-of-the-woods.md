Looking at it now <br />
It all seems so simple <br />
We were lying on your couch <br />
I remember <br />
You took a Polaroid of us <br />
Then discovered <br />
(Then discovered) <br />
The rest of the world was black and white <br />
But we were in screaming color <br />
And I remember thinking <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
In the clear yet, good <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
In the clear yet, good <br />
(Are we out of the woods?) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Looking at it now <br />
Last December <br />
(Last December) <br />
We were built to fall apart <br />
Then fall back together <br />
(Back together) <br />
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck <br />
The night we couldn't quite forget <br />
When we decided, we decided <br />
To move the furniture so we could dance <br />
Baby, like we stood a chance <br />
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying <br />
And I remember thinking <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
In the clear yet, good <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
In the clear yet, good <br />
(Are we out of the woods?) <br />

<p className="bridge">
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon? <br />
Twenty stitches in a hospital room <br />
When you started crying, baby, I did too <br />
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you <br />
Remember when we couldn't take the heat? <br />
I walked out, I said "I'm setting you free" <br />
But the monsters turned out to be just trees <br />
When the sun came up you were looking at me <br />
You were looking at me, oh <br />
You were looking at me <br />
(Are we out of the woods yet?) <br />
(Are we out of the woods yet?) <br />
(Are we out of the woods yet?) <br />
(Are we out of the woods?) <br />
I remember <br />
(Are we in the clear yet?) <br />
(Are we in the clear yet?) <br />
Oh, I remember <br />

<p className="chorus">

Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah) <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
In the clear yet, good <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />

In the clear yet, good <br />
