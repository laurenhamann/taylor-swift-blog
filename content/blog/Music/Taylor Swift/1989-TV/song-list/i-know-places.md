<p className="intro">
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I <br />
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I <br />
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I <br />
I, I, (I, I) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
You stand with your hand on my waistline <br />
It's a scene, and we're out here in plain sight <br />
I can hear them whisper as we pass by <br />
It's a bad sign, bad sign <br />
Something happens when everybody finds out <br />
See the vultures circling, dark clouds <br />
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out <br />
It could burn out <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes <br />
And guns <br />
They are the hunters, we are the foxes <br />
And we run <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Baby, I know places we won't be found and <br />
They'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down <br />
'Cause I, I know places we can hide <br />
I know places <br />
I know places <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences <br />
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it <br />
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time <br />
Not this time <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it <br />
My love <br />
They are the hunters, we are the foxes <br />
And we run <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Baby, I know places we won't be found and <br />
They'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down <br />
'Cause I, I know places we can hide <br />
I know places <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
They are the hunters, we are the foxes <br />
And we run <br />
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it <br />
My love <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Baby, I know places we won't be found and <br />
They'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down <br />
'Cause I, I know places we can hide <br />
I know places <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof <br />
I know places <br />
(I) and you know for me, it's always you <br />
I know places <br />
(I) in the dead of night, your eyes so green <br />
I know places <br />
(I) and I know for you, it's always me <br />
I know places <br />
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I <br />
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I (I, I, I) <br />
</p>
