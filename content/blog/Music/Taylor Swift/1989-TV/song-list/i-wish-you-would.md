<p className="verse-one">
It's 2 A.M. in your car <br />
Windows down, I pass my street <br />
The memories start <br />
You say it's in the past <br />
And drive straight ahead <br />
You think I'm gonna hate you now <br />
'Cause you still don't know what I never said <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wish you would come back <br />
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did <br />
I wish you knew that <br />
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
It's 2 A.M. in my room <br />
Headlights pass the window pane <br />
I think of you <br />
We're a crooked love <br />
In a straight line down <br />
Makes you wanna run and hide <br />
Then it makes you turn right back around <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wish you would come back <br />
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did <br />
I wish you knew that <br />
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />
I wish we could go back <br />
And remember what we were fighting for <br />
Wish you knew that <br />
I miss you too much to be mad anymore <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I <br />
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I <br />
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
You gave me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
Stand back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I wish, I wish, I) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
2 A.M., here we are <br />
See your face <br />
Hear my voice in the dark <br />
We're a crooked love <br />
In a straight line down <br />
Guess you wanna run and hide <br />
But it made us turn right back around <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wish you would come back <br />
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did <br />
I wish you knew that <br />
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />
I wish you would come back <br />
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did <br />
I wish you knew that <br />
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />
I wish we could go back <br />
And remember what we were fighting for <br />
Wish you knew that <br />
I miss you too much to be mad anymore <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />
