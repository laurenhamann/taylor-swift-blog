<p className="verse-one">
You went to a party <br />
I heard from everybody <br />
You part the crowd like the Red Sea <br />
Don't even get me started <br />
Did you get anxious though <br />
On the way home? <br />
I guess I'll never, ever know <br />
Now that we don't talk <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You grew your hair long <br />
You got new icons <br />
And from the outside <br />
It looks like you're tryin' lives on <br />
I miss the old ways <br />
You didn't have to change <br />
But I guess I don't have a say <br />
Now that we don't talk <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I call my mom, she said that it was for the best <br />
Remind myself, the more I gave, you'd want me less <br />
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost <br />
And what it cost, now that we don't talk <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
What do you tell your friends we <br />
Shared dinners, long weekends with? <br />
Truth is, I can't pretend it's <br />
Platonic, it's just ended, so <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest) <br />
Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left (Until I left) <br />
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost) <br />
And what it cost, now that we don't talk <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I don't have to pretend I like acid rock <br />
Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht <br />
With important men who think important thoughts <br />
Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk <br />
And the only way back to my dignity <br />
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery <br />
Just like I had been when you were chasing me <br />
Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
“Now That We Don’t Talk” is one of my favorite songs that was left behind, it was so hard to leave it behind, but I think we wrote it a little bit towards the end of the process and we couldn’t get the production right at the time. But we had tons of time to perfect the production this time and figure out what we wanted this song to sound like. I think it’s the shortest song I’ve ever had, but I think it packs a punch, I think it really goes in. For the short amount of time we have, I think it makes its point.
- <b> Taylor Swift </b>
