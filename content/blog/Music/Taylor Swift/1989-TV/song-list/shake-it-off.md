<p className="verse-one">
I stay out too late <br />
Got nothing in my brain <br />
That's what people say, mmm-mmm <br />
That's what people say, mmm-mmm <br />
I go on to many dates, ha-ha <br />
But I can't make them stay <br />
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm <br />
That's what people say, mmm-mmm <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But I keep cruising <br />
Can't stop, won't stop moving <br />
It's like I got this music <br />
In my mind <br />
Saying, "It's gonna be alright <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play <br />
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate <br />
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake <br />
Shake it off, I shake it off <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break <br />
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake <br />
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake <br />
Shake it off, I shake it off <br />
I never miss a beat <br />
I'm lightning on my feet <br />
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm <br />
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm <br />
I'm dancing on my own (Dancing on my own) <br />
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go) <br />
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm <br />
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But I keep cruising <br />
Can't stop, won't stop grooving <br />
It's like I got this music <br />
In my mind <br />
Saying, "It's gonna be alright." <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
"Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play <br />
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate <br />
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake <br />
Shake it off, I shake it off <br />
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break <br />
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake <br />
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake <br />
Shake it off, I shake it off <br />
I shake it off, I shake it off <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">

<p className="interlude">
Hey, hey, hey <br />
Just think, while you've been getting down and out abo <br />ut
The liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world <br />
You could've been getting down to this sick beat <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend <br />
She's like "Oh, my God", but I'm just gonna shake <br />
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair <br />
Won't you come on over, baby? <br />
We can shake, shake <br />
Shake <br />
Yeah, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play <br />
And the haters gonns hate, hate, hate, hate, hate <br />
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake <br />
Shake it off, I shake it off <br />
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break <br />
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake <br />
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake <br />
Shake it off, I shake it off <br />
