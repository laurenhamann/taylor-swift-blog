<p className="verse-one">
We're all bored <br />
We're all so tired of everything <br />
We wait for trains that just aren't coming <br />
We show off our different scarlet letters <br />
Trust me, mine is better <br />
We're so young <br />
But we're on the road to ruin <br />
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doin' <br />
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom <br />
Honey, life is just a classroom <br />
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause baby, I could build a castle <br />
Out of all the bricks they threw at me <br />
And every day is like a battle <br />
But every night with us is like a dream <br />
Baby, we're the new romantics <br />
Come on, come along with me <br />
Heartbreak is the national anthem <br />
We sing it proudly <br />
We are too busy dancing <br />
To get knocked off our feet <br />
Baby, we're the new romantics <br />
The best people in life are free <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
We're all here <br />
The lights and noise are blinding <br />
We hang back <br />
It's all in the timing <br />
It's poker <br />
He can't see it in my face <br />
But I'm about to play my Ace (ah) <br />
We need love <br />
But all we want is danger <br />
We team up <br />
Then switch sides like a record changer <br />
The rumors are terrible and cruel <br />
But honey, most of them are true <br />
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause baby, I could build a castle <br />
Out of all the bricks they threw at me <br />
And every day is like a battle <br />
But every night with us is like a dream <br />
Baby, we're the new romantics <br />
Come on, come along with me <br />
Heartbreak is the national anthem <br />
We sing it proudly <br />
We are too busy dancing <br />
To get knocked off our feet <br />
Baby, we're the new romantics <br />
The best people in life are free <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Oh-oh <br />
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) <br />
So, come on, come along with me <br />
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) <br />
The best people in life are free <br />
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Please take my hand and <br />
Please take me dancing, and <br />
Please leave me stranded <br />
It's so romantic (it's so romantic) <br />
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, 'cause baby, I could build a castle <br />
Out of all the bricks they threw at me <br />
And every day is like a battle (oh-oh) <br />
But every night with us is like a dream <br />
'Cause baby, I could build a castle (castle) <br />
Out of all the bricks they threw at me <br />
And every day is like a battle <br />
But every night with us is like a dream <br />
Baby, we're the new romantics <br />
Come on, come along with me <br />
Heartbreak is the national anthem <br />
We sing it proudly <br />
We are too busy dancing <br />
To get knocked off our feet <br />
Baby, we're the new romantics <br />
The best people in life are free <br />
