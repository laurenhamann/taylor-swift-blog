<p className="intro">
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh) <br />
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh) <br />
I slept all alone (Uh-huh) <br />
You still wouldn't go <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later <br />
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters <br />
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor <br />
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Was it over when she laid down on your couch? <br />
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse? <br />
"Come here," I whispered in your ear <br />
In your dream as you passed out, baby <br />
Was it over then? And is it over now? <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
(Is it? Is it? Is it?) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
When you lost control (Uh-huh) <br />
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh) <br />
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh) <br />
Your new girl is my clone <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And did you think I didn't see you? <br />
There were flashin' lights <br />
At least I had the decency <br />
To keep my nights out of sight <br />
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs <br />
And my whispered sighs <br />
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin' <br />
Off of very tall somethings <br />
Just to see you come runnin' <br />
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh) <br />
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no) <br />
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh) <br />
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Was it over when she laid down on your couch? <br />
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse? <br />
"Come here," I whispered in your ear <br />
In your dream as you passed out, baby <br />
Was it over then? And is it over now? <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Uh-huh <br />
(Is it? Is it? Is it?) <br />
Uh-huh <br />
(Is it? Is it?) <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Think I didn't see you? <br />
There were flashin' lights <br />
At least I had the decency <br />
To keep my nights out of sight <br />
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs <br />
And my whispered sighs <br />
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin' <br />
Off of very tall somethings <br />
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin') <br />
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh) <br />
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh) <br />
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there <br />
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord) <br />
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord) <br />
But no <br />
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?) <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
“Is It Over Now” is a song I wanted to end the album with because I think it’s kind of a fun play on words of like, “Is the album over now?” I always saw this song as sort of a sister to “Out Of The Woods” and “I Wish You Would,” I kind of saw those songs as similar, so, unfortunately, when we were making these decisions of what to put on 1989 and what to leave behind, I had to make some tough choices and now it doesn’t matter anymore because you guys are going to hear all the songs. I’m so happy this song is out. I really love the “let’s fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later,” that session, I just feel like head banging to every time it comes on. Hope you agree.
