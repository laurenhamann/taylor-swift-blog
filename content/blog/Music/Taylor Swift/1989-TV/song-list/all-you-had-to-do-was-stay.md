<p className="verse-one">
People like you always want back the love they gave away <br />
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed <br />
The more I think about it now, the less I know <br />
All I know is that you drove us off the road <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Stay <br />
Hey, all you had to do was stay <br />
Had me in the palm of your hand <br />
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in? <br />
Hey, now you say you want it back <br />
Now that it's just too late <br />
Well, it could've been easy <br />
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
All you had to do was stay <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say <br />
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made <br />
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside <br />
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hey, all you had to do was stay <br />
Had me in the palm of your hand <br />
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in? <br />
Hey, now you say you want it back <br />
Now that it's just too late <br />
Well, it could've been easy <br />
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
All you had to do was (stay, stay, stay, stay, stay) <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Let me remind you <br />
This was what you wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh) <br />
You ended it <br />
You were all I wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh) <br />
But not like this <br />
Not like this <br />
Not like this <br />
Oh, all you had to do was- <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hey, all you had to do was stay <br />
Had me in the palm of your hand <br />
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in? <br />
Hey, now you say you want it back <br />
Now that it's just too late <br />
Well, it could've been easy <br />
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
Hey, all you had to do was stay <br />
Had me in the palm of your hand <br />
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in? <br />
Hey, now you say you want it back <br />
Now that it's just too late <br />
Well, it could've been easy (all you had to do was stay) <br />
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
All you had to do was (stay) oh <br />
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
All you had to do was (stay) ooh <br />
All you had to do was (stay) <br />
</p>
