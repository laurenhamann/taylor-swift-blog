<p className="verse-one">
Nice to meet you, where you been? <br />
I could show you incredible things <br />
Magic, madness, heaven, sin <br />
Saw you there and I thought <br />
Oh my God, look at that face <br />
You look like my next mistake <br />
Love's a game, wanna play? Ayy <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
New money, suit and tie <br />
I can read you like a magazine <br />
Ain't it funny, rumors fly <br />
And I know you heard about me <br />
So hey, let's be friends <br />
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends <br />
Grab your passport and my hand <br />
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So it's gonna be forever <br />
Or it's gonna go down in flames <br />
You can tell me when it's over, mm <br />
If the high was worth the pain <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane <br />
'Cause you know I love the players <br />
And you love the game <br />
'Cause we're young and we're reckless <br />
We'll take this way too far <br />
It'll leave you breathless, mm <br />
Or with a nasty scar <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane <br />
But I've got a blank space, baby <br />
And I'll write your name <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Cherry lips, crystal skies <br />
I could show you incredible things <br />
Stolen kisses, pretty lies <br />
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen <br />
Find out what you want <br />
Be that girl for a month <br />
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-four">
Screaming, crying, perfect storms <br />
I can make all the tables turn <br />
Rose garden filled with thorns <br />
Keep you second guessin' like <br />
"Oh my God, who is she?" <br />
I get drunk on jealousy <br />
But you'll come back each time you leave <br />
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So it's gonna be forever <br />
Or it's gonna go down in flames <br />
You can tell me when it's over, mm <br />
If the high was worth the pain <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane <br />
'Cause you know I love the players <br />
And you love the game <br />
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh) <br />
We'll take this way too far <br />
It'll leave you breathless, mm <br />
Or with a nasty scar <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane (insane) <br />
But I've got a blank space, baby <br />
And I'll write your name <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Boys only want love if it's torture <br />
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya <br />
Boys only want love if it's torture <br />
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So it's gonna be forever <br />
Or it's gonna go down in flames <br />
You can tell me when it's over (over), mm <br />
If the high was worth the pain <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane <br />
'Cause you know I love the players <br />
And you love the game <br />
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (yeah) <br />
We'll take this way too far <br />
It'll leave you breathless, mm <br />
Or with a nasty scar <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane <br />
But I've got a blank space, baby <br />
And I'll write your name <br />
