<p className="verse-one">
The moon is high <br />
Like your friends were the night that we first met <br />
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet <br />
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed <br />
The wine is cold <br />
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street <br />
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three <br />
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night <br />
(Oh!) Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright <br />
Three times 'cause I've waited my whole life <br />
(One, two, one two three four!) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings <br />
Uh huh, that's right <br />
Darling, you're the one I want, and <br />
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this <br />
Uh huh, that's right <br />
Darling, you're the one I want <br />
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams <br />
Oh, you're the one I want <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool <br />
When you jumped in first, I went in too <br />
I'm with you even if it makes me blue <br />
Which takes me back <br />
To the color that we painted your brother's wall <br />
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws <br />
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night <br />
(Oh!) Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright <br />
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life <br />
(One, two, one two three four!) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings <br />
Uh huh, that's right <br />
Darling, you're the one I want, and <br />
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this <br />
Uh huh, that's right <br />
Darling, you're the one I want <br />
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams <br />
Oh, you're the one I want <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I want to drive away with you <br />
I want your complications too <br />
I want your dreary Mondays <br />
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy <br />
I want to drive away with you <br />
I want your complications too <br />
I want your dreary Mondays <br />
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy <br />
Uh huh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings <br />
Uh huh, that's right <br />
You're the one I want <br />
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this <br />
Uh huh <br />
Darling, you're the one I want <br />
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings <br />
Uh huh, that's right <br />
Darling, you're the one I want, and <br />
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this <br />
Uh huh, that's right <br />
Darling, you're the one I want <br />
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams <br />
You're the one I want <br />
In paper rings, in picture frames, and all my dreams <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, you're the one I want <br />
You're the one I want, one I want <br />
You're the one I want, one I want <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I wrote ‘Paper Rings’ with this idea of throwback sounds. We didn’t want to use any sounds that were very modern on this song. This song talks about true love and if you really find true love, you probably don’t really care what the symbolism of that love is. Material things wouldn’t matter to you anymore if you found someone that you just wanted to live your life with. <br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>
