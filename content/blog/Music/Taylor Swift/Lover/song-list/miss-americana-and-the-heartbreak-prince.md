<p className="verse-one">
You know I adore you <br />
I'm crazier for you <br />
Than I was at 16 <br />
Lost in a film scene <br />
Waving homecoming queens <br />
Marching band playing <br />
I'm lost in the lights <br />
American glory <br />
Faded before me <br />
Now I'm feeling hopeless <br />
Ripped up my prom dress <br />
Running through rose thorns <br />
I saw the scoreboard <br />
And ran for my life <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
No cameras catch my pageant smile <br />
I counted days, I counted miles <br />
To see you there, to see you there <br />
It's been a long time coming, but <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's you and me <br />
That's my whole world <br />
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (okay) <br />
The whole school is rolling fake dice <br />
You play stupid games <br />
You win stupid prizes <br />
It's you and me <br />
There's nothing like this <br />
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay) <br />
We're so sad, we paint the town blue <br />
Voted most likely to run away with you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
My team is losing <br />
Battered and bruising <br />
I see the high fives <br />
Between the bad guys <br />
Leave with my head hung <br />
You are the only one <br />
Who seems to care <br />
American stories <br />
Burning before me <br />
I'm feeling helpless <br />
The damsels are depressed <br />
Boys will be boys then <br />
Where are the wise men? <br />
Darling, I'm scared <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
No cameras catch my muffled cries <br />
I counted days, I counted miles <br />
To see you there, to see you there <br />
And now the storm is coming, but <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's you and me <br />
That's my whole world <br />
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (okay) <br />
The whole school is rolling fake dice <br />
You play stupid games <br />
You win stupid prizes <br />
It's you and me <br />
There's nothing like this <br />
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay) <br />
We're so sad, we paint the town blue <br />
Voted most likely to run away with you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I don't want you to (go) <br />
I don't really wanna (fight) <br />
'Cause nobody's gonna (win) <br />
I think you should come home <br />
And I don't want you to (go) <br />
I don't really wanna (fight) <br />
'Cause nobody's gonna (win) <br />
I think you should come home <br />
And I don't want you to (go) <br />
I don't really wanna (fight) <br />
'Cause nobody's gonna (win) <br />
I just think you should know <br />
And I'll never let you (go) <br />
'Cause I know this is a (fight) <br />
That someday we're gonna (win) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's you and me <br />
That's my whole world <br />
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" <br />
Oh, I just thought you should know <br />
You should know <br />
It's you and me <br />
There's nothing like this (like this) <br />
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay) <br />
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (paint it blue) <br />
Voted most likely to run away with you <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
And I don't want you to (go) <br />
I don't really wanna (fight) <br />
'Cause nobody's gonna (win) <br />
I think you should come home <br />
And I'll never let you (go) <br />
'Cause I know this is a (fight) <br />
That one day we're gonna (win) <br />
I just think you should know <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
It's you and me <br />
That's my whole world <br />
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" <br />
"She's a bad, bad girl" <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
There are so many influences that go into that particular song. I wrote it a couple of months after midterm elections, and I wanted to take the idea of politics and pick a metaphorical place for that to exist. And so I was thinking about a traditional American high school, where thereâ€™s all these kinds of social events that could make someone feel completely alienated. And I think a lot of people in our political landscape are just feeling like we need to huddle up under the bleachers and figure out a plan to make things better. - Taylor Swift
