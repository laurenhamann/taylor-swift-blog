<p className="verse-one">
How many days did I spend <br />
Thinkin' 'bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong? <br />
Lived in the shade you were throwin' <br />
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone <br />
And I couldn't get away from ya <br />
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah <br />
Your name on my lips, tongue tied <br />
Free rent, livin' in my mind <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But then something happened one magical night <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I forgot that you existed <br />
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't <br />
And it was so nice <br />
So peaceful and quiet <br />
I forgot that you existed <br />
It isn't love, it isn't hate <br />
It's just indifference <br />
I forgot that you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Got out some popcorn <br />
As soon as my rep starting going down, down, down <br />
Laughed on the schoolyard <br />
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground <br />
And I would've stuck around for ya <br />
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah <br />
Would've been right there, front row <br />
Even if nobody came to your show <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But you showed who you are, then one magical night <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I forgot that you existed <br />
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't <br />
And it was so nice <br />
So peaceful and quiet <br />
I forgot that you existed <br />
It isn't love, it isn't hate <br />
It's just indifference <br />
I forgot that you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Sent me a clear message <br />
Taught me some hard lessons <br />
I just forget what they were <br />
It's all just a blur <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I forgot that you existed <br />
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't <br />
And it was so nice <br />
So peaceful and quiet <br />
I forgot that you existed <br />
I did, I did, I did <br />
It isn't hate, it's just indifference <br />
It isn't love, it isn't hate <br />
It's just indifference (so yeah) <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I was writing with two writers I hadn’t ever worked with before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. So I had this idea called “I Forgot That You Existed,” and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you’ve been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain. And just, one day you wake up and you realize you’re indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. <br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>

<blockquote>
With the first song on this new album I wanted to bring us out the ‘reputation’ era. ‘reputation’ for me was about grieving the loss of your reputation and all of the phases you go through.

This song closes the book on ‘reputation’ in resolving that whole conflict with a shrug. “Well, I guess I’m over it now, because I forgot that you existed.” <br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>
