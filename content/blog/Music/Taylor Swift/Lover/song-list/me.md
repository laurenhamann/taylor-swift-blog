I promise that you'll never find another like me <br />
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh <br />
I know I never think before I jump <br />
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want <br />
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there) <br />
I know that I went psycho on the phone <br />
I never leave well enough alone <br />
And trouble's gonna follow where I go <br />
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But one of these things is not like the others <br />
Like a rainbow with all of the colors <br />
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover <br />
I promise that you'll never find another like <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh <br />
I'm the only one of me <br />
Baby, that's the fun of me <br />
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh <br />
You're the only one of you <br />
Baby, that's the fun of you <br />
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I know I tend to make it about me <br />
I know you never get just what you see <br />
But I will never bore you, baby <br />
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there) <br />
And when we had that fight out in the rain <br />
You ran after me and called my name <br />
I never wanna see you walk away <br />
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause one of these things is not like the others <br />
Livin' in winter, I am your summer <br />
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover <br />
I promise that you'll never find another like <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh <br />
I'm the only one of me <br />
Let me keep you company <br />
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh <br />
You're the only one of you <br />
Baby, that's the fun of you <br />
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Hey, kids! <br />
Spelling is fun! <br />
Girl, there ain't no I in "team" <br />
But you know there is a "me" <br />
Strike the band up, one, two, three <br />
I promise that you'll never find another like me <br />
Girl, there ain't no I in "team" <br />
But you know there is a "me" <br />
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me" <br />
I promise that you'll never find another like <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Me-e-e (yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (and I won't stop, baby) <br />
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me) <br />
Baby, that's the fun of me (baby, that's the fun of me) <br />
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (oh) <br />
You're the only one of you (oh) <br />
Baby, that's the fun of you <br />
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Girl, there ain't no I in "team" (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) <br />
But you know there is a "me" <br />
I'm the only one of me (oh-oh) <br />
Baby, that's the fun of me <br />
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) <br />
Strike the band up, one, two, three <br />
You can't spell "awesome" without "me" <br />
You're the only one of you <br />
Baby, that's the fun of you <br />
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
‘ME!’ is a song about embracing your individuality and really celebrating it, and owning it. I think that with a pop song, we have the ability to get a melody stuck in people’s heads, and I want it to be one that makes them feel better about - Taylor Swift
