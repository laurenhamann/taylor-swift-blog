<p className="verse-one">
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair <br />
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared <br />
That was the first time we were there <br />
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you <br />
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too <br />
And I say to you... <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ooh-ah <br />
Soon, you'll get better <br />
Ooh-ah <br />
Soon, you'll get better <br />
Ooh-ah <br />
You'll get better soon <br />
'Cause you have to <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror <br />
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal <br />
I just pretend it isn't real <br />
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky <br />
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try <br />
And I say to you... <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ooh-ah <br />
Soon, you'll get better <br />
Ooh-ah <br />
Soon, you'll get better <br />
Ooh-ah <br />
You'll get better soon <br />
'Cause you have to <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge fave">
And I hate to make this all about me <br />
But who am I supposed to talk to? <br />
What am I supposed to do <br />
If there's no you? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was <br />
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because <br />
'Cause I have to <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Ooh-ah <br />
You'll get better <br />
Ooh-ah <br />
Soon, you'll get better <br />
Ooh-ah <br />
You'll get better soon <br />
Ooh-ah <br />
Soon, you'll get better <br />
Ooh-ah <br />
Soon, you'll get better <br />
Ooh-ah <br />
You'll get better soon <br />
'Cause you have to <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
here’s a song called Soon You’ll Get Better that was really really hard to write, and it was also a family decision whether to even put it on the album. And I think songs like that that are really hard for you to write emotionally, maybe they are really hard to write and hard to sing because they are really true. <br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>
