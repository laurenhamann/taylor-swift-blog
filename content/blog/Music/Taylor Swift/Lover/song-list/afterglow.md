<p className="verse-one">
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue <br />
Put you in jail for something you didn't do <br />
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh <br />
Thought I had reason to attack, but no <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves <br />
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us <br />
Why'd I have to break what I love so much? <br />
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hey <br />
It's all me in my head <br />
I'm the one who burned us down <br />
But it's not what I meant <br />
Sorry that I hurt you <br />
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you <br />
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you <br />
I need to say, hey <br />
It's all me, just don't go <br />
Meet me in the afterglow <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
It's so excruciating to see you low <br />
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go <br />
This ultraviolet morning light below <br />
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I lived like an island, punished you with silence <br />
Went off like sirens, just crying <br />
Why'd I have to break what I love so much? <br />
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hey <br />
It's all me in my head <br />
I'm the one who burned us down <br />
But it's not what I meant <br />
I'm sorry that I hurt you <br />
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you <br />
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you <br />
I need to say, hey <br />
It's all me, just don't go <br />
Meet me in the afterglow <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Tell me that you're still mine <br />
Tell me that we'll be just fine <br />
Even when I lose my mind <br />
I need to say <br />
Tell me that it's not my fault <br />
Tell me that I'm all you want <br />
Even when I break your heart <br />
I need to say, hey <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's all me in my head <br />
I'm the one who burned us down <br />
But it's not what I meant <br />
Sorry that I hurt you <br />
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you <br />
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you <br />
I need to say, hey <br />
It's all me, just don't go <br />
Meet me in the afterglow <br />
</p>
