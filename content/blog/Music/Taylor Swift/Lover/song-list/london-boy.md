<p className="verse-one">
I love my hometown <br />
As much as Motown, I love SoCal <br />
And you know I love Springsteen <br />
Faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey <br />
But something happened, I heard him laughing <br />
I saw the dimples ﬁrst and then I heard the accent <br />
They say home is where the heart is <br />
But that's not where mine lives <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You know I love a London boy <br />
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon <br />
He likes my American smile <br />
Like a child when our eyes meet <br />
Darling, I fancy you <br />
Took me back to Highgate <br />
Met all of his best mates <br />
So I guess all the rumors are true <br />
You know I love a London boy <br />
Boy, I fancy you, ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
And now I love high tea <br />
Stories from Uni and the West End <br />
You can ﬁnd me in the pub <br />
We are watchin' rugby with his school friends <br />
Show me a grey sky, a rainy cab ride <br />
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time <br />
They say home is where the heart is <br />
But God, I love the English <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You know I love a London boy <br />
I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon <br />
He likes my American smile <br />
Like a child when our eyes meet <br />
Darling, I fancy you <br />
Took me back to Highgate <br />
Met all of his best mates <br />
So I guess all the rumors are true <br />
You know I love a London boy <br />
Boy, I fancy you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
So please show me Hackney <br />
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street <br />
Just wanna be with you <br />
Wanna be with you <br />
Stick with me, I'm your queen <br />
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath <br />
Just wanna be with you (wanna be with you) <br />
Wanna be with you (oh) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause you know I love a London boy <br />
I enjoy walking Soho, drinking in the afternoon (yeah) <br />
He likes my American smile <br />
Like a child when our eyes meet <br />
Darling, I fancy you (you) <br />
Took me back to Highgate <br />
Met all of his best mates <br />
So I guess all the rumors are true (yeah) <br />
You know I love a London boy (oh) <br />
Boy (oh), I fancy you (I fancy you) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
So please show me Hackney <br />
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street <br />
Just wanna be with you <br />
(Boy, boy, I fancy you, oh whoa, oh, oh) <br />
Stick with me, I'm your queen <br />
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath <br />
Just wanna be with you <br />
(Wanna be with you) <br />
(I fancy you, yeah, I fancy you) <br />
Ooh wooh ooh <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
This is supposed to be over the course of 3 years. Like, somebody told me, ‘they think that you’re talking about one day,’ and I was like, ‘oh no, you’d never make it. You wouldn’t make it. You’d make it in 3 years.’ - Taylor Swift
