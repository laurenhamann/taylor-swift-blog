<p className="verse-one">
… School bell rings, walk me home <br />
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow <br />
Lost my gloves, you give me one <br />
"Wanna hang out?" <br />
"Yeah, sounds like fun" <br />
Video games <br />
You pass me a note <br />
Sleeping in tents <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
… It's nice to have a friend <br />
It's nice to have a friend <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
… Light pink sky <br />
Up on the roof <br />
Sun sinks down <br />
No curfew <br />
20 questions <br />
We tell the truth <br />
You been stressed out lately <br />
Yeah, me too <br />
Something gave you the nerve <br />
To touch my hand <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
… It's nice to have a friend <br />
It's nice to have a friend <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
… Church bells ring <br />
Carry me home <br />
Rice on the ground <br />
Looks like snow <br />
Call my bluff <br />
Call you "babe" <br />
Have my back, yeah, every day <br />
Feels like home <br />
Stay in bed <br />
The whole weekend <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
… It's nice to have a friend <br />
It's nice to have a friend <br />
It's nice to have a friend <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
There’s a song on Lover about flashback and childhood, it compares childhood friendships to when you find someone to fall in love with when you’re older, called “It’s Nice To Have A Friend.” It’s very nostalgic.<br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>
