<p className="verse-one">
You are somebody that I don't know <br />
But you're taking shots at me like it's Patrón <br />
And I'm just like "Damn, it's 7:00 a.m." <br />
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out <br />
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out <br />
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?" <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I ain't trying to mess with your self-expression <br />
But I've learned the lesson that stressin' <br />
And obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun <br />
And snakes and stones never broke my bones so <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh <br />
You need to calm down <br />
You're being too loud <br />
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh) <br />
You need to just stop <br />
Like, can you just not step on my gown? <br />
You need to calm down <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You are somebody that we don't know <br />
But you're coming at my friends like a missile <br />
Why are you mad? <br />
When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD) <br />
Sunshine on the street at the parade <br />
But you would rather be in the dark ages <br />
Making that sign, must've taken all night <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace<br />
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate<br />
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay so<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh<br />
You need to calm down<br />
You're being too loud<br />
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)<br />
You need to just stop<br />
Like, can you just not step on his gown?<br />
You need to calm down<br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And we see you over there on the internet<br />
Comparing all the girls who are killing it<br />
But we figured you out<br />
We all know now, we all got crowns<br />
You need to calm down<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh<br />
You need to calm down (you need to calm down)<br />
You're being too loud (you're being too loud)<br />
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)<br />
You need to just stop (can you stop?)<br />
Like, can you just not step on our gowns?<br />
You need to calm down<br />
<br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
It’s about how I’ve observed a lot of different people in our society who just put so much energy and effort into negativity, and it just made me feel like, “You need to just calm down, like you’re stressing yourself out. This seems like it’s more about you than what you’re going off about. Like, just calm down.” - Taylor Swift
