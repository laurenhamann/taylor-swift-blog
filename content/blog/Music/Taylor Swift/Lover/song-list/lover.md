<p className="verse-one">
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January <br />
This is our place, we make the rules <br />
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear <br />
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Can I go where you go? <br />
Can we always be this close forever and ever? <br />
And ah, take me out, and take me home <br />
You're my, my, my, my lover <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
We could let our friends crash in the living room <br />
This is our place, we make the call <br />
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants yo <br />u
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Can I go where you go? <br />
Can we always be this close forever and ever? <br />
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever) <br />
You're my, my, my, my lover <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand? <br />
With every guitar string scar on my hand <br />
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover <br />
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue <br />
All's well that ends well to end up with you <br />
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover <br />
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me <br />
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Can I go where you go? <br />
Can we always be this close forever and ever? <br />
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever) <br />
You're my, my, my, my <br />
Oh, you're my, my, my, my <br />
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
This has one of my favorite bridges. I love a bridge, and I was really able to go to Bridge City. - Taylor Swift
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I chose this song as the title track because itâ€™s such a perfect example of what I was trying to do with this album. I wanted to make music that in a lot of ways feels timeless and is really confessional. I wrote this one alone. Jack Antonoff helped produce this song and we wanted to make music that could have been played on a wedding reception stage in 1970. <br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>
