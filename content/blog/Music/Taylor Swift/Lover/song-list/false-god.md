<p className="verse-one">
We were crazy to think <br />
Crazy to think that this could work <br />
Remember how I said I'd die for you? <br />
We were stupid to jump <br />
In the ocean separating us <br />
Remember how I'd fly to you? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I can't talk to you when you're like this <br />
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town <br />
I'm New York City <br />
I still do it for you, babe <br />
They all warned us about times like this <br />
They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you're led by blind faith <br />
Blind faith <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But we might just get away with it <br />
Religion's in your lips <br />
Even if it's a false god <br />
We'd still worship <br />
We might just get away with it <br />
The altar is my hips <br />
Even if it's a false god <br />
We'd still worship this love <br />
We'd still worship this love <br />
We'd still worship this love <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I know heaven's a thing <br />
I go there when you touch me <br />
Honey hell is when I fight with you <br />
But we can patch it up good <br />
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness <br />
Got the wine for you <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this <br />
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you <br />
You're the West Village <br />
You still do it for me, babe <br />
They all warned us about times like this <br />
They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you're led by blind faith <br />
Blind faith <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But we might just get away with it <br />
Religion's in your lips <br />
Even if it's a false god <br />
We'd still worship <br />
We might just get away with it <br />
The altar is my hips <br />
Even if it's a false god <br />
We'd still worship this love <br />
We'd still worship this love <br />
We'd still worship this love, ah <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Still worship this love <br />
Even if it's a false god <br />
Even if it's a false god <br />
Still worship this love <br />
</p>
