<p className="verse-one">
I think he knows his footprints <br />
On the sidewalk <br />
Lead to where I can't stop <br />
Go there every night <br />
I think he knows his hands around <br />
A cold glass <br />
Make me wanna know that body <br />
Like it's mine <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
He got that boyish look that I like in a man <br />
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans <br />
It's like I'm seventeen, nobody understands <br />
No one understands <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
He got my heartbeat <br />
Skipping down 16th Avenue <br />
Got that, oh! I mean <br />
Wanna see what's under that attitude <br />
Like, I want you, bless my soul <br />
And I ain't gotta tell him <br />
I think he knows <br />
I think he knows <br />
I think he knows <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
When we get all alone <br />
I'll make myself at home <br />
And he'll want me to stay <br />
I think he knows <br />
He better lock it down <br />
Or I won't stick around <br />
'Cause good ones never wait <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
He got that boyish look that I like in a man <br />
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans <br />
He's so obsessed with me, and boy I understand <br />
Boy I understand <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
He got my heartbeat <br />
Skipping down 16th Avenue <br />
Got that, oh! I mean <br />
Wanna see what's under that attitude <br />
Like, I want you, bless my soul <br />
And I ain't gotta tell him <br />
I think he knows <br />
I think he knows <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I want you, bless my <br />
I want you, bless my <br />
I want you, bless my <br />
I want you, bless my soul <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh <br />
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive <br />
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh <br />
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive <br />
So where we gonna go? <br />
I whisper in the dark <br />
Where we gonna go? <br />
I think he knows <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
He got my heartbeat <br />
Skipping down 16th Avenue <br />
Got that, oh! I mean <br />
Wanna see what's under that attitude <br />
Like, I want you, bless my soul <br />
And I ain't gotta tell him <br />
I think he knows <br />
I think he knows <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I want you, bless my <br />
I want you, bless my <br />
I want you, bless my <br />
I want you, bless my soul <br />
I want you, bless my <br />
I want you, bless my <br />
I want you, bless my soul <br />
I ain't gotta tell him <br />
I think he knows <br />
