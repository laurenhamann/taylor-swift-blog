<p className="verse-one">
Combat<br />
I'm ready for combat<br />
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?<br />
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies<br />
I've got a hundred thrown out speeches I almost said to you<br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Easy they come, easy they go<br />
I jump from the train, I ride off alone<br />
I never grew up, it's getting so old<br />
Help me hold onto you<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I've been the archer<br />
I've been the prey<br />
Who could ever leave me, darling?<br />
But who could stay?<br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Dark side<br />
I search for your dark side<br />
But what if I'm all right, right, right, right here?<br />
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face<br />
Then hate my reflection, for years and years<br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost<br />
The room is on fire, invisible smoke<br />
And all of my heroes die all alone<br />
Help me hold onto you<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I've been the archer<br />
I've been the prey<br />
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling?<br />
But who could stay?<br />
'Cause they see right through me<br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
They see right through me<br />
They see right through<br />
Can you see right through me?<br />
They see right through<br />
They see right through me<br />
I see right through me<br />
I see right through me<br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
All the king's horses and all the king's men<br />
Couldn't put me together again<br />
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends<br />
Help me hold onto you<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I've been the archer<br />
I've been the prey<br />
Who could ever leave me, darling?<br />
But who could stay?<br />
And who could stay?<br />
Who could stay?<br />
Who could stay?<br />
Who could stay?<br />
You could stay<br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Combat<br />
I'm ready for combat<br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
This song is about how, maybe in our lives if we’ve been let down, or things haven’t turned out the way that we wanted to in relationships… how often times we can kind of have this phantom fear of tragedy, like phantom tragedy… where you’re like, if you ever find something really great, or a situation that is solid, or a situation where your trust isn’t being broken… sometimes you have to deal with your demons from all those times that it didn’t work. You have to stop yourself from thinking the worst is always going to happen. And this is a song that touches on anxiety, and how to break patterns and cycles that aren’t healthy, because we learn a lot in life. Some of the lessons are good, and some of the habits are good, and some of the habits are bad. So it’s a song about having to unlearn some bad lessons that you learned in the past.<br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>
