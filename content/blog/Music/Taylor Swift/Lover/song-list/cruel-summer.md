<p className="verse-one">
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night <br />
You know that I caught it <br />
Bad, bad boy <br />
Shiny toy with a price <br />
You know that I bought it <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Killing me slow, out the window <br />
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below <br />
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes <br />
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And it's new, the shape of your body <br />
It's blue, the feeling I've got <br />
And it's ooh, whoa, oh <br />
It's a cruel summer <br />
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em <br />
No rules in breakable heaven <br />
But ooh, whoa oh <br />
It's a cruel summer <br />
With you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Hang your head low <br />
In the glow of the vending machine <br />
I'm not dying <br />
You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times <br />
We're not trying <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife <br />
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone <br />
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes <br />
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body <br />
It's blue, the feeling I've got <br />
And it's ooh, whoa, oh <br />
It's a cruel summer <br />
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em <br />
No rules in breakable heaven <br />
But ooh, whoa, oh <br />
It's a cruel summer <br />
With you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I'm drunk in the back of the car <br />
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh) <br />
Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true <br />
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you <br />
And I snuck in through the garden gate <br />
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh) <br />
And I screamed for whatever it's worth <br />
"I love you, " ain't that the worst thing you ever heard? <br />
He looks up grinning like a devil <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's new, the shape of your body <br />
It's blue, the feeling I've got <br />
And it's ooh, whoa, oh <br />
It's a cruel summer <br />
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em <br />
No rules, in breakable heaven <br />
But ooh, whoa, oh <br />
It's a cruel summer <br />
With you <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I'm drunk in the back of the car <br />
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh) <br />
Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true <br />
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you <br />
And I snuck in through the garden gate <br />
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh) <br />
And I screamed for whatever it's worth <br />
"I love you, " ain't that the worst thing you ever heard? <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
This song is one that I wrote about the feeling of a summer romance, and how often times a summer romance can be layered with all these feelings of, like, pining away and sometimes even secrecy. It deals with the idea of being in a relationship where there’s some element of desperation and pain in it, where you’re yearning for something that you don’t quite have yet, it’s just right there, and you just, like, can’t reach it. So, this has some of my favorite lyrics on it, and it was so fun to write this. Jack and Annie [Clark] did the track and a lot of the instrumentation, and I did the topline in whatever language that is. A topline is all the notes and the lyrics you hear. So whatever you would sing, that is what I wrote on this. It was just so fun to write this one and I really love this one. Jack and I like to do ranting bridges. Like in “Out of the Woods” where the bridge is the biggest moment of the song — we revisited that concept. - Taylor Swift

<blockquote>
 I wrote this song with two people I’m a huge fan of, Jack Antonoff and Annie Clark of St. Vincent. I wanted this song to feel like a desperate summer love that might be doomed from the start. My favourite line from this song is, “I love you. Ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?” - Taylor Swift
