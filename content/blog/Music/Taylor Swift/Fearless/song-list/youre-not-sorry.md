<p className="verse-one">
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around <br />
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down <br />
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out <br />
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You don't have to call anymore, I won't pick up the phone <br />
This is the last straw, don't wanna hurt anymore <br />
And you can tell me that you're sorry <br />
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before <br />
You're not sorry, no-no-no-no <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know <br />
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold <br />
And you've got your share of secrets, and I'm tired of being last to know, oh <br />
And now you're asking me to listen, 'cause it's worked each time before <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But you don't have to call anymore, I won't pick up the phone <br />
This is the last straw, don't wanna hurt anymore <br />
And you can tell me that you're sorry <br />
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before <br />
You're not sorry, no-no-no-no <br />
You're not sorry, no-no-no-no <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no <br />
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So you don't have to call (call), anymore (anymore), I won't pick up the phone <br />
This is the last straw, there's nothing left to beg for <br />
And you can tell me that you're sorry <br />
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before <br />
You're not sorry, no-no-no-no <br />
You're not sorry, no-no-no-no <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
No-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no <br />
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh <br />
Oh-oh-oh-no-no <br />
No-no-no-no <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
It is about this guy who turned out to not be who I thought he was. He came across as Prince Charming. Well, it turned out prince charming had a lot of secrets that he didn’t tell me about. And one by one, I would figure them out. I would find out who he really was. I wrote this when I was at the breaking point of, ‘You know what? Don’t even think that you can keep on hurting me.’ It was to a point where I had to walk away. - Taylor Swift

## Secret liner note
