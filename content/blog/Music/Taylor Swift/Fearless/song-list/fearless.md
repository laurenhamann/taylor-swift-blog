<p className="verse-one">
There's somethin' bout the way <br />
The street looks when it's just rained <br />
There's a glow off the pavement <br />
You walk me to the car <br />
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there <br />
In the middle of the parking lot <br />
Yeah <br />
Oh, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
We're drivin' down the road <br />
I wonder if you know <br />
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now <br />
But you're just so cool <br />
Run your hands through your hair <br />
Absent mindedly makin' me want you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I don't know how it gets better than this <br />
You take my hand and drag me head first <br />
Fearless <br />
And I don't know why <br />
But with you I'd dance in a storm <br />
In my best dress <br />
Fearless <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
So baby drive slow <br />
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town <br />
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat <br />
You put your eyes on me <br />
In this moment now capture it, remember it <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this <br />
You take my hand and drag me head first <br />
Fearless <br />
And I don't know why <br />
But with you I'd dance in a storm <br />
In my best dress <br />
Fearless <br />
Oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Well you stood there with me in the doorway <br />
My hands shake <br />
I'm not usually this way but <br />
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave <br />
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something,  <br />it's fearless
Oh, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this <br />
You take my hand and drag me head first <br />
Fearless <br />
And I don't know why <br />
But with you I'd dance in a storm <br />
In my best dress <br />
Fearless <br />
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this <br />
You take my hand and drag me head first <br />
Fearless <br />
And I don't know why <br />
But with you I'd dance in a storm <br />
In my best dress <br />
Fearless <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, oh, oh yeah <br />
</p>

## Quote from Artist

<blockquote>
To me, fearless is not the absence of fear. It''s not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you’ve been hurt before. […] No matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and Prince Charmings and happily ever after. That''s why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless. - Taylor Swift

<blockquote>
This is a song about the fearlessness of falling in love. No matter how many break up songs you write, no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again. When I wrote ‘Fearless,’ I wasn’t dating anyone. I wasn’t even in the beginning stages of dating anybody. I really was all by myself out on tour and I got this idea for a song about the best first date. I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had. So, this song is about the best first date I haven’t had yet. - Taylor Swift
