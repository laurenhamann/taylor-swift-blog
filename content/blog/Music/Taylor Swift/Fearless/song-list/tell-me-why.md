<p className="verse-one">
I took a chance, I took a shot <br />
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not <br />
You took a swing, I took it hard <br />
And down here from the ground, I see who you are <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm sick and tired of your attitude <br />
I'm feeling like I don't know you <br />
You tell me that you love me, then you cut me down <br />
And I need you like a heartbeat <br />
But you know you got a mean streak <br />
Makes me run for cover when you're around <br />
And here's to you and your temper <br />
Yes, I remember what you said last night <br />
And I know that you see what you're doing to me <br />
Tell me why <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You could write a book on <br />
How to ruin someone's perfect day <br />
Well, I get so confused and frustrated <br />
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm sick and tired of your reasons <br />
I got no one to believe in <br />
You tell me that you want me, then push me around <br />
And I need you like a heartbeat <br />
But you know you got a mean streak <br />
Makes me run for cover when you're around <br />
Here's to you and your temper <br />
Yes, I remember what you said last night <br />
And I know that you see what you're doing to me <br />
Tell me why <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Why do you have to make me feel small <br />
So you can feel whole inside? <br />
Why do you have to put down my dreams <br />
So you're the only thing on my mind? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When I'm sick and tired of your attitude <br />
I'm feeling like I don't know you <br />
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down <br />
I'm sick and tired of your reasons <br />
I've got no one to believe in <br />
You ask me for my love, then you push me around <br />
Here's to you and your temper <br />
Yes, I remember what you said last night <br />
And I know that you see what you're doing to me <br />
Tell me why, why? <br />
Tell me why <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I take a step back, let you go <br />
I told you I'm not bulletproof <br />
Now you know <br />
</p>

## Quote from Artist

<blockquote>
I’d been talking to a guy I’ve never “officially” dated. Sometimes it’s the hardest thing when you have all these dreams of dating them, and you’re getting close, but it doesn’t work out. He would say things that would make me go, “Did you just say that?” It bothered me so much because he would say one thing and do another, do one thing and say another. Because he didn’t know what he wanted, he would just play all these mind games. - Taylor Swift
