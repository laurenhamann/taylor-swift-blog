<p className="verse-one">
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel <br />
Comes out just when you need it to <br />
As I paced back and forth all this time <br />
'Cause I honestly believed in you <br />
Holdin' on, the days drag on <br />
Stupid girl, I should've known, I should've known <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale <br />
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet <br />
Lead her up the stairwell <br />
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town <br />
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down <br />
Now it's too late for you and your white horse <br />
To come around <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes <br />
And never really had a chance <br />
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love <br />
You had to fight to have the upper hand <br />
I had so many dreams about you and me <br />
Happy endings, now I know <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale <br />
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet <br />
Lead her up the stairwell <br />
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town <br />
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down <br />
Now it's too late for you and your white horse <br />
To come around <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And there you are on your knees <br />
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me <br />
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale <br />
I'm gonna find someone someday <br />
Who might actually treat me well <br />
This is a big world, that was a small town <br />
There in my rear-view mirror disappearing now <br />
And it's too late for you and your white horse <br />
Now it's too late for you and your white horse <br />
To catch me now <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa <br />
Try and catch me now, oh <br />
It's too late <br />
To catch me now <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
It’s one of the songs that I am really proud of on the record because it’s so sparse—it’s guitar, piano, and cello. It talks about falling in love and the fairy tales that you are going to have with this person, and then there is that moment where you realize that it is not going to happen. That moment is the most earth-shattering moment. - Taylor Swift
