<p className="verse-one">
He is sensible and so incredible <br />
And all my single friends are jealous <br />
He says everything I need to hear and it's like <br />
I couldn't ask for anything better <br />
He opens up my door and I get into his car <br />
And he says you look beautiful tonight <br />
And I feel perfectly fine <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain <br />
And it's two AM and I'm cursing your name <br />
You're so in love that you act insane <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
Breakin' down and coming undone <br />
It's a roller coaster kinda rush <br />
And I never knew I could feel that much <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
He respects my space <br />
And never makes me wait <br />
And he calls exactly when he says he will <br />
He's close to my mother <br />
Talks business with my father <br />
He's charming and endearing <br />
And I'm comfortable <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain <br />
And it's two AM and I'm cursing your name <br />
You're so in love that you act insane <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
Breakin' down and coming undone <br />
It's a roller coaster kinda rush <br />
And I never knew I could feel that much <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
He can't see the smile I'm faking <br />
And my heart's not breaking <br />
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all <br />
And you were wild and crazy <br />
Just so frustrating, intoxicating <br />
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain <br />
It's two AM and I'm cursing your name <br />
I'm so in love that I acted insane <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
Breakin' down and coming undone <br />
It's a roller coaster kinda rush <br />
And I never knew I could feel that much <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
Whoa whoa oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Whoa <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
Oh oh-oh, ooh <br />
Oh oh-oh, whoa <br />
Never knew I could feel that much <br />
And that's the way I loved you <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I got this idea for a song about being in a relationship with a nice guy who is punctual and opens up the door for you and brings you flowers… but you feel nothing. The whole time you’re with him, you’re thinking about the guy who was complicated and messy and frustrating. - Taylor Swift

## Secret liner note

“We can’t go back.”
