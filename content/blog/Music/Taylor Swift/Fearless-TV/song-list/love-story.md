<p className="verse-one">
We were both young when I first saw you <br />
I close my eyes and the flashback starts <br />
I'm standing there <br />
On a balcony, in summer air <br />
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns <br />
See you make your way through the crowd <br />
And say, "Hello" <br />
Little did I know <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
That you were 
Romeo, you were throwing pebbles <br />
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet" <br />
And I was crying on the staircase <br />
Begging you, "Please don't go" <br />
And I said <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
"Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone <br />
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run <br />
You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess <br />
It's a love story, baby, just say yes" <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
So I sneak out to the garden to see you <br />
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew <br />
So close your eyes <br />
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter <br />
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet" <br />
But you were everything to me <br />
I was begging you, "Please don't go" <br />
And I said <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone <br />
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run <br />
You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess <br />
It's a love story, baby, just say yes" <br />
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel <br />
This love is difficult, but it's real <br />
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess <br />
It's a love story, baby, just say yes <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Oh, oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I got tired of waiting <br />
Wondering if you were ever coming around <br />
My faith in you was fading <br />
When I met you on the outskirts of town <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I said <br />
"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone <br />
I keep waiting for you, but you never come <br />
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think" <br />
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring <br />
And said <br />
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone <br />
I love you, and that's all I really know <br />
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress <br />
It's a love story, baby, just say yes" <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, oh-oh <br />
Oh, oh-oh, oh <br />
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I was going through a situation like that where I could relate. I used to be in high school where you see a boyfriend every day. Then I was in a situation where it wasn’t so easy for me, and I wrote this song because I could relate to the whole Romeo and Juliet thing. I was really inspired by that story. Except for the ending. I feel like they had such promise and they were so crazy for each other. And if that had just gone a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it’s a tragedy. I thought, why can’t you… make it a happy ending and put a key change in the song and turn it into a marriage proposal. - Taylor Swift
