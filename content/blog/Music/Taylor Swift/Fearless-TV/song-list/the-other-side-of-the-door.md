<p className="verse-one">
In the heat of the fight, I walked away <br />
Ignorin' words that you were sayin' <br />
Tryna make me stay <br />
I said, "This time I've had enough" <br />
And you've called a hundred times <br />
But I'm not picking up <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over <br />
But if you look a little closer <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I said, "Leave", but all I really want is you <br />
To stand outside my window, throwin' pebbles <br />
Screamin', "I'm in love with you" <br />
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more <br />
And don't you leave, 'cause I know <br />
All I need is on the other side of the door <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone <br />
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone <br />
I keep goin' back over things we both said <br />
And I remember the slamming door <br />
And all the things that I misread <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh, babe, if you know everything <br />
Tell me why you couldn't see <br />
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I said, "Leave", but all I really want is you <br />
To stand outside my window, throwin' pebbles <br />
Screamin', "I'm in love with you" <br />
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more <br />
And don't you leave, 'cause I know <br />
All I need is on the other side of the door <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I'll scream out the window <br />
I can't even look at you <br />
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do <br />
I say, "There's nothing you can say <br />
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it" <br />
But what I mean is <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I said, "Leave", but, baby, all I want is you <br />
To stand outside my window, throwin' pebbles <br />
Screamin', "I'm in love with you" <br />
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more <br />
And don't you leave, 'cause I know <br />
All I need is on the other side of the door <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
With your face and the beautiful eyes <br />
And the conversation with the little white lies <br />
And the faded picture of a beautiful night <br />
You carried me from your car up the stairs <br />
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess? <br />
After everything and that little black dress <br />
After everything I must confess, I need you <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
It talks about when you’re in a fight with someone you’re in a relationship with and you’re like, “Leave me alone, don’t ever talk to me – I hate you!”. But what you really mean is, “Please go buy me flowers and beg that I forgive you and stand at the door and don’t leave for three days.” It’s like all about the dramatics of relationships where you’re like, “I hate you so much, I don’t ever want to talk to you again!” , if you mean the opposite. So that’s a fun one that I’m really excited about getting out there. - Taylor Swift
