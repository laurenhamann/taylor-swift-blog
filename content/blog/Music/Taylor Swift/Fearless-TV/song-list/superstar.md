<p className="verse-one">
This is wrong, but I can't help but feel like <br />
There ain't nothing more right, babe <br />
Misty morning comes again and I can't <br />
Help but wish I could see your face <br />
I knew from the first note played <br />
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you <br />
You smile that beautiful smile <br />
And all the girls in the front row scream your name <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like <br />
"I can't take my eyes off of you" <br />
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl <br />
Who's desperately in love with you <br />
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall <br />
Superstar <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Morning loneliness comes around <br />
When I'm not dreaming about you <br />
When my world wakes up today <br />
You'll be in another town <br />
And I knew when I saw your face <br />
I'd be counting down the ways to see you <br />
And you smile that beautiful smile <br />
And all the girls in the front row scream your name <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like <br />
"I can't take my eyes off of you" <br />
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl <br />
Who's desperately in love with you <br />
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall <br />
Superstar <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You played in bars, you play guitar <br />
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are <br />
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep <br />
Every night from the radio <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like <br />
"I can't take my eyes off of you" <br />
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl <br />
Who's desperately in love with you <br />
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall <br />
Superstar <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Sweet, sweet superstar <br />
Superstar <br />

## Secret liner note

I'll never tell
