<p className="verse-one">
Mr. "Perfect face" <br />
Mr. "Here to stay" <br />
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away" <br />
Everything was right <br />
Mr. "I've been waiting for you all my life" <br />
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side" <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart" <br />
Mr. "Leaves me all alone, " I fall apart <br />
It takes everything in me just to get up each day <br />
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine" <br />
How's your heart after breaking mine? <br />
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time, " baby <br />
Hello Mr. "Casually cruel" <br />
Mr. "Everything revolves around you" <br />
I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye <br />
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine" <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Mr. "Never told me why" <br />
Mr. "Never had to see me cry" <br />
Mr. "Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy" <br />
He goes about his day <br />
Forgets he ever even heard my name <br />
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest <br />
I guess you're all the same <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl <br />
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her <br />
And I never got past what you put me through <br />
But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine" <br />
How's your heart after breakin' mine? <br />
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time, " baby <br />
Hello Mr. "Casually cruel" <br />
Mr. "Everything revolves around you" <br />
I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye <br />
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine" <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
So dignified in your well-pressed suit <br />
So strategized, all the eyes on you <br />
Sashay away to your seat <br />
It's the best seat, in the best room <br />
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins" <br />
So far above me in every sense <br />
So far above feeling anything <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And it's really such a shame <br />
It's such a shame <br />
'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay" <br />
Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday" <br />
And someday maybe you'll miss me <br />
But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Goodbye Mr. "Perfectly fine" <br />
How's your heart after breakin' mine? <br />
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time, " baby <br />
Goodbye Mr. "Casually cruel" <br />
Mr. "Everything revolves around you" <br />
I've been Miss "Misery" for the last time <br />
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine" <br />
You're perfectly fine <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Mr. "Look me in the eye and told me you would never go away" <br />
You said you'd never go away <br />
</p>

## Quote from Artist

<blockquote>
Mr. Perfectly fine is a song that I wrote alone. It was definitely an early indicator of me sort of creeping towards a pop sensibility. Iâ€™ve always listened to every type of music and even though Fearless is a country album, there were always these pop melodies creeping in. But I really love this song, and I love the bridge, I think the lyrics are just wonderfully scathing, and full of the teen angst that you would hope to hear on an album I wrote when I was 17 or 18, or you know, on that cusp. - Taylor Swift
