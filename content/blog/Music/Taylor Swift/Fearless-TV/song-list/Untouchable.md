<p className="verse-one">
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky <br />
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why <br />
I'm caught up in you <br />
I'm caught up in you <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun <br />
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream <br />
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name <br />
You gotta come on, come on <br />
Say that we'll be together <br />
Come on, come on <br />
Little taste of heaven <br />
Oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
It's half full and I won't wait here all day <br />
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun <br />
And now that you're close I feel like coming undone <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream <br />
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name <br />
You gotta come on, come on <br />
Say that we'll be together <br />
Come on, come on, oh <br />
In the middle of the night, we can form this dream <br />
I wanna feel you by my side, standing next to me <br />
You gotta come on, come on <br />
Say that we'll be together <br />
Come on, come on <br />
Little taste of heaven <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I'm caught up in you <br />
Oh, oh <br />
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun <br />
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream <br />
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name <br />
You gotta come on, come on <br />
Say that we'll be together <br />
Come on, come on <br />
Oh, oh, oh <br />
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream <br />
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name <br />
You gotta, come on, come on <br />
Say that we'll be together <br />
Come on, come on <br />
Come on <br />
In the middle of the night, we can form this dream <br />
I wanna feel you by my side, standing next to me <br />
You gotta come on, come on <br />
Say that we'll be together <br />
Come on, come on <br />
Little taste of heaven <br />
Oh, oh <br />
Oh <br />
Oh <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
And in the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream <br />
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name <br />
You gotta come on, come on <br />
Oh, come on, come on <br />
Come on, come on <br />
Oh, oh, oh, oh <br />
Like a million little stars <br />
Spellin' out your name <br />
They're spellin' out your name <br />
Oh <br />
</p>
