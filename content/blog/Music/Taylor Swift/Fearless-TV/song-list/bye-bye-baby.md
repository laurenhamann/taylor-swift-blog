<p className="verse-one">
It wasn't just like a movie <br />
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin <br />
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say <br />
This is the last time I'll drive this way again <br />
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray <br />
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side <br />
Bye, bye, baby <br />
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing <br />
And all I have is your sympathy <br />
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me <br />
Bye, bye, baby <br />
Bye, bye, baby <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
The picture frame is empty <br />
On the dresser, vacant just like me <br />
I see your writing on the dash <br />
Then back to your hesitation <br />
I was so sure of everything <br />
Everything I thought we'd always have <br />
Guess I never doubted it <br />
Then the here and the now floods in <br />
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side <br />
Bye, bye, baby <br />
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing <br />
And all I have is your sympathy <br />
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me <br />
Bye, bye, baby <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
There's so much that I can't touch <br />
You're all I want but it's not enough this time <br />
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands <br />
And I'm so scared of how this ends <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side <br />
Bye, bye, baby <br />
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing <br />
And all I have is your sympathy <br />
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side <br />
Bye, bye, baby <br />
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing <br />
And all I have is your sympathy <br />
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me <br />
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me <br />
Bye, bye, baby <br />
Bye, bye, baby <br />
</p>
