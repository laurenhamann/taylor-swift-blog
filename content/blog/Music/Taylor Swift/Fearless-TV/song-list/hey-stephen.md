<p className="intro">
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm <br />
Mmm-mm, mm-mm <br />
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm <br />
Mmm-mm, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving <br />
But I know I saw a light in you <br />
And as we walked we would talk <br />
And I didn't say half the things I wanted to <br />
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window <br />
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold <br />
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing <br />
I don't always have to be alone <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel <br />
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so <br />
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you <br /> 
Can't help it if there's no one else <br />
Mmm, I can't help myself <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling <br />
So I've got some things to say to you (ha) <br />
I've seen it all, so I thought <br />
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do <br />
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name <br />
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change <br />
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving? <br />
I think you and I should stay the same <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel <br />
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so <br />
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you <br />
Can't help it if there's no one else <br />
Mmm, I can't help myself <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
They're dimming the street lights <br />
You're perfect for me <br />
Why aren't you here tonight? <br />
I'm waiting alone now <br />
So come on and come out <br />
And pull me near <br />
And shine, shine, shine <br />
Hey Stephen, I could give you 50 reasons <br />
Why I should be the one you choose <br />
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful <br />
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I can't help it if you look like an angel <br />
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so <br />
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you <br />
Can't help it if there's no one else <br />
Mmm, I can't help myself <br />
If you look like an angel <br />
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so <br />
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you <br />
Can't help it if there's no one else <br />
Mmm I can't help myself <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Myself <br />
Can't help myself, I can't help myself <br />
Oh, oh, oh <br />
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm <br />
Mmm-mm, mm-mm <br />
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm <br />
Mmm-mm, mm-mm <br />
Mm-mm <br />
</p>

## Quote from Artist

<blockquote>
This is a guy I had a crush on. I wrote about all these reasons he should be with me instead of other girls (…). This guy has absolutely no idea I had a crush on him. It’s gonna be kind of interesting when he finds out. - Taylor Swift
