<p className="verse-one">
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement <br />
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do <br />
The way the tires turn stones, on old county roads <br />
They leave 'em muddy underneath <br />
Reminds me of you <br />
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls <br />
You know, you can scratch it right off <br />
It's how it used to be <br />
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in <br />
You can't change where it's been <br />
Reminds me of me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I lived, and I learned <br />
Had you, got burned <br />
Held out, and held on <br />
God knows, too long <br />
And wasted time, lost tears <br />
Swore that I'd get out of here <br />
But no amount of freedom gets you clean <br />
I've still got you all over me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
The best and worst day of June <br />
Was the one that I met you <br />
With your hands in your pockets <br />
And your 'don't you wish you had me' grin <br />
But I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child <br />
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I lived, and I learned <br />
Had you, got burned <br />
Held out, and held on <br />
God knows, too long <br />
And wasted time, lost tears <br />
Swore that I'd get out of here <br />
But no amount of freedom gets you clean <br />
I've still got you all over me <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I lived, and I learned <br />
And found out what it was to turn around <br />
And see, that we <br />
Were never really meant to be <br />
So I lied, and I cried <br />
And I watched a part of myself die <br />
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean <br />
I've still got you all over me <br />
I've still got you all over me <br />
Still got you all over me <br />
</p>
