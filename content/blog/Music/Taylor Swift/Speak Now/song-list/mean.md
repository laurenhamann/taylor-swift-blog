<p className="verse-one">
You, with your words like knives <br />
And swords and weapons that you use against me <br />
You have knocked me off my feet again <br />
Got me feeling like I'm nothing <br />
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard <br />
Calling me out when I'm wounded <br />
You, picking on the weaker man <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Well, you can take me down <br />
With just one single blow <br />
But you don't know what you don't know <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city <br />
And all you're ever gonna be is mean <br />
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me <br />
And all you're ever gonna be is mean <br />
Why you gotta be so mean? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You, with your switching sides <br />
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation <br />
You have pointed out my flaws again <br />
As if I don't already see them <br />
I walk with my head down <br />
Trying to block you out, 'cause I'll never impress you <br />
I just wanna feel okay again <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I bet you got pushed around <br />
Somebody made you cold <br />
But the cycle ends right now <br />
'Cause you can't lead me down that road <br />
And you don't know what you don't know <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city <br />
And all you're ever gonna be is mean <br />
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me <br />
And all you're ever gonna be is mean <br />
Why you gotta be so mean? <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I can see you years from now in a bar <br />
Talking over a football game <br />
With that same big loud opinion <br />
But nobody's listening <br />
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things <br />
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing <br />
But all you are is mean <br />
</p>
<p className="builtup">
All you are is mean <br />
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life <br />
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city <br />
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah <br />
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me <br />
And all you're ever gonna be is mean <br />
(Why you gotta be so mean?) <br />
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city <br />
(Why you gotta be so mean?) <br />
And all you're ever gonna be is mean <br />
(Why you gotta be so mean?) <br />
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me <br />
(Why you gotta be so mean?) <br />
And all you're ever gonna be is mean <br />
Why you gotta be so mean? <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
When you do what I do, which is you put yourself out there for a lot of people to say whatever they want about it, there are a million different opinions from a million different people.I get it that not everyone is going to like everything that you do, and I get that no matter what, you’re going to be criticized for something. But I also get that there are different kinds of ways to criticize someone. There is constructive criticism. There’s professional criticism. And then, there’s just being mean. There’s a line that you cross when you just start to attack everything about a person, and there’s one guy who just crossed the line over and over again. Just being mean, and saying things that would ruin my day. […] There’s always going to be someone who’s just mean to you. Dealing with that is all you can control about that situation, how you handle it. ‘Mean’ is about how I handle it, and sort of my mindset about this whole situation. - Taylor Swift
