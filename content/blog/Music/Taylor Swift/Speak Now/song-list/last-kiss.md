<p className="verse-one">
I still remember the look on your face <br />
Lit through the darkness at 1:58 <br />
The words that you whispered for just us to know <br />
You told me you loved me, so why did you go <br />
Away? <br />
Away <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I do recall now the smell of the rain <br />
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane <br />
That July 9th, the beat of your heart <br />
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But now I'll go <br />
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes <br />
All that I know is I don't know <br />
How to be somethin' you miss <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I never thought we'd have a last kiss <br />
I never imagined we'd end like this <br />
Your name, forever the name on my lips <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
I do remember the swing of your step <br />
The life of the party, you're showin' off again <br />
And I'd roll my eyes, and then you pull me in <br />
I'm not much for dancin', but for you I did <br />
Because I love your handshake, meetin' my father <br />
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets <br />
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of sayin' somethin' <br />
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I'll go <br />
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes <br />
All that I know is I don't know <br />
How to be somethin' you miss <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I never thought we'd have a last kiss <br />
I never imagined we'd end like this <br />
Your name, forever the name on my lips <br />
Ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep <br />
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe <br />
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are <br />
Hope it's nice where you are <br />
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day <br />
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed <br />
You can plan for a change in weather and time <br />
But I never planned on you changin' your mind <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
So I'll go <br />
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes <br />
All that I know is I don't know <br />
How to be somethin' you miss <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I never thought we'd have a last kiss <br />
I never imagined we'd end like this <br />
Your name, forever the name on my lips <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Just like our last kiss <br />
Forever the name on my lips <br />
Forever the name on my lips <br />
Just like our last <br />
 <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
The song ‘Last Kiss’ is sort of like a letter to somebody. You say all of these desperate, hopeless feelings that you have after a break-up. Going through a break-up you feel all of these different things. You feel anger, and you feel confusion, and frustration. Then there is the absolute sadness. The sadness of losing this person, losing all the memories, and the hopes you had for the future. There are times when you have this moment of truth where you just admit to yourself that you miss all these things. When I was in one of those moments I wrote this song. - Taylor Swift
