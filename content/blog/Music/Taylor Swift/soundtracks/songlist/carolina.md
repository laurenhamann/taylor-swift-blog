<p className="verse-one">
Oh, Carolina creeks running through my veins <br />
Lost I was born, lonesome I came <br />
Lonesome I'll always stay <br />
Carolina knows why, for years, I roam <br />
Free as these birds, light as whispers <br />
Carolina knows <br />
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
And you didn't see me here <br />
No, they never did see me here <br />
And she's in my dreams <br />
</p>

<p className="chorus">
Into the mist, into the clouds <br />
Don't leave <br />
I make a fist, I'll make it count <br />
And there are places I will never, ever go <br />
And things that only Carolina will ever know <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
Carolina stains on the dress she left <br />
Indelible scars, pivotal marks <br />
Blue as the life she fled <br />
Carolina pines, won't you cover me? <br />
Hide me like robes down the back road <br />
Muddy these webs we weave <br />
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
And you didn't see me here <br />
Oh, they never did see me <br />
And she's in my dreams <br />
</p>

<p className="chorus">
Into the mist, into the clouds <br />
Don't leave <br />
I make a fist, I'll make it count <br />
And there are places I will never, ever go <br />
And things that only Carolina will ever know <br />
</p>

<p className="bridge">
And you didn't see me here <br />
They never did see me here <br />
No, you didn't see me here <br />
They never saw me <br />
</p>

<p className="outro">
Oh, Carolina knows why for years they've said <br />
That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liar's bed <br />
But the sleep comes fast and I'll meet no ghosts <br />
It's between me, the sand, and the sea <br />
Carolina knows <br />
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
Where The Crawdads Sing is a book I got absolutely lost in when I read it years ago. As soon as I heard there was a film in the works starring the incredible Daisy Edgar Jones and produced by the brilliant Reese Witherspoon, I knew I wanted to be a part of it from the musical side. I wrote the song “Carolina” alone and asked my friend Aaron Dessner to produce it. I wanted to create something haunting and ethereal to match this mesmerizing story.

<blockquote>
About a year & half ago I wrote a song about the story of a girl who always lived on the outside, looking in. Figuratively & literally. The juxtaposition of her loneliness & independence. Her curiosity & fear all tangled up. Her persisting gentleness & the world’s betrayal of it. I wrote this one alone in the middle of the night and then Aaron Dessner and I meticulously worked on a sound that we felt would be authentic to the moment when this story takes place. I made a wish that one day you would hear it. ‘Carolina’ is out now
