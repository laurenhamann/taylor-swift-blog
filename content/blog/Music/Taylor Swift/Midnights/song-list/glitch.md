<p className="verse-one">
We were supposed to be just friends <br />
You don't live in my part of town, but maybe I'll see you out some weekend <br />
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I'm in <br />
And what's in my system <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah <br />
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah <br />
And I'm not even sorry <br />
Nights are so starry, blood moonlit <br />
It must be counterfeit <br />
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I was supposed to sweat you out <br />
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground <br />
But it's been two thousand one hundred and 90 days of our love blackout <br />
The system's breaking down (the system's breaking down) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I think there's been a glitch <br />
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch <br />
And I'm not even sorry <br />
Nights are so starry, blood moonlit <br />
It must be counterfeit <br />
I think there's been a glitch <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
A brief interruption, a slight malfunction <br />
I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing <br />
I thought we had no chance <br />
And that's romance, let's dance <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Glitch  <br />
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch <br />
And I'm not even sorry <br />
Nights are so starry, blood moonlit <br />
It must be counterfeit <br />
I think there's been a glitch <br />
</p>
