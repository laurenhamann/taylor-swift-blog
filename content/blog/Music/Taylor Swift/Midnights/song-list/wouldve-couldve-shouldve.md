<p className="verse-one">
If you would've blinked then I would've <br />
Looked away at the first glance <br />
If you tasted poison, you could've <br />
Spit me out at the first chance <br />
If I was some paint, did it splatter <br />
On a promising grown man? <br />
And if I was a child, did it matter <br />
If you got to wash your hands? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Ooh, oh <br />
All I used to do was pray <br />
Would've, could've, should've <br />
If you'd never looked my way <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I would've stayed on my knees <br />
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil <br />
At nineteen <br />
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven <br />
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts <br />
Memories feel like weapons <br />
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
If you never touched me, I would've <br />
Gone along with the righteous <br />
If I never blushed, then they could've <br />
Never whispered about this <br />
And if you never saved me from boredom <br />
I could've gone on as I was <br />
But, Lord, you made me feel important <br />
And then you tried to erase us <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Ooh, oh <br />
You're a crisis of my faith <br />
Would've, could've, should've <br />
If I'd only played it safe <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I would've stayed on my knees <br />
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil <br />
At nineteen <br />
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven <br />
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts <br />
Memories feel like weapons <br />
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
God rest my soul, I miss who I used to be <br />
The tomb won't close, stained glass windows in my mind <br />
I regret you all the time <br />
I can't let this go, I fight with you in my sleep <br />
The wound won't close, I keep on waiting for a sign <br />
I regret you all the time <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
If clarity's in death, then why won't this die? <br />
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I <br />
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts <br />
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil <br />
At nineteen <br />
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven <br />
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts <br />
Memories feel like weapons <br />
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
God rest my soul, I miss who I used to be <br />
The tomb won't close, stained glass windows in my mind <br />
I regret you all the time <br />
I can't let this go, I fight with you in my sleep <br />
The wound won't close, I keep on waiting for a sign <br />
I regret you all the time <br />
Oh, God rest my soul, I miss who I used to be <br />
The tomb won't close, stained glass windows in my mind <br />
I regret you all the time <br />
I can't let this go, I fight with you in my sleep <br />
The wound won't close, I keep on waiting for a sign <br />
I regret you all the time <br />
