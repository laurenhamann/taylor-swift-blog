<p className="verse-one">
I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser <br />
Midnights become my afternoons <br />
When my depression works the graveyard shift <br />
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I should not be left to my own devices <br />
They come with prices and vices <br />
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time) <br />
I wake up screaming from dreaming <br />
One day I'll watch as you're leaving <br />
'Cause you got tired of my scheming <br />
(For the last time) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me <br />
At tea time, everybody agrees <br />
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror <br />
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby <br />
And I'm a monster on the hill <br />
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city <br />
Pierced through the heart, but never killed <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism <br />
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time) <br />
I wake up screaming from dreaming <br />
One day I'll watch as you're leaving <br />
And life will lose all its meaning <br />
(For the last time) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) <br />
At tea time, everybody agrees <br />
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror <br />
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money <br />
She thinks I left them in the will <br />
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out <br />
"She's laughing up at us from hell" <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me <br />
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me <br />
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me) <br />
At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees) <br />
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror <br />
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero <br />
</p>

## Quote from artist

<blockquote>
“Anti-Hero” is one of my favorite songs I’ve ever written. I really don’t think I’ve delved this far into my insecurities in this detail before. I struggle with the idea that my life has become unmanageably sized and I, not to sound too dark, but I just struggle with the idea of not feeling like a person. This song is a real guided tour throughout all the things I tend to hate about myself, and it’s all those aspects of the things we dislike and like about ourselves that we have to come to terms with if we are gonna be this person, so I like “Anti-Hero” a lot, because I think is really honest.

<blockquote>
The story of "Anti-Hero" is that it really encapsulates this album and sort of the darkest corners of your mind when you can't sleep. Playing out a dismal version of your very dark future, um, being afraid of what everyone thinks about you. Really exploring your own self-loathing and kind of having a shocking, scary self-awareness about your flaws as a human being, you know? Anxiety, it's, uh, it's all throughout this song.
<br /><b>- Taylor Swift</b>
