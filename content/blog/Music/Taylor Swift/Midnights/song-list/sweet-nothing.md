<p className="verse-one">
I spy with my little tired eye <br />
Tiny as a firefly <br />
A pebble that we picked up last July <br />
Down deep inside your pocket <br />
We almost forgot it <br />
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes? <br />
Ooh, ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
They said the end is comin' <br />
Everyone's up to somethin' <br />
I found myself a-runnin' home to your sweet nothings <br />
Outside they're push and shovin' <br />
You're in the kitchen hummin' <br />
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin' <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
On the way home <br />
I wrote a poem <br />
You say, "What a mind" <br />
This happens all the time <br />
Ooh, ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause they said the end is comin' <br />
Everyone's up to somethin' <br />
I found myself a-runnin' home to your sweet nothings <br />
Outside they're push and shovin' <br />
You're in the kitchen hummin' <br />
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin' <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Industry disruptors <br />
And soul deconstructors <br />
And smooth-talking hucksters <br />
Out glad-handing each other <br />
And the voices that implore <br />
"You should be doing more" <br />
To you, I can admit <br />
That I'm just too soft for all of it <br />
Ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
They said the end is comin' <br />
Everyone's up to somethin' <br />
I found myself a-runnin' home to your sweet nothings <br />
Outside they're push and shovin' <br />
You're in the kitchen hummin' <br />
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin' <br />
They said the end is comin' (they said the end is comin') <br />
Everyone's up to somethin' (everyone's up to somethin') <br />
I found myself a-runnin' home to your sweet nothings <br />
Outside they're push and shovin' (outside they're push and shovin') <br />
You're in the kitchen hummin' (you're in the kitchen hummin') <br />
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin' <br />
</p>
