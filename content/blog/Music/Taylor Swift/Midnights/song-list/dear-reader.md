<p className="verse-one">
Dear reader <br />
If it feels like a trap, you're already in one <br />
Dear reader <br />
Get out your map, pick somewhere and just run <br />
Dear reader <br />
Burn all the files, desert all your past lives <br />
And if you don't recognize yourself <br />
That means you did it right <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart <br />
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart <br />
(You should find another) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Dear reader <br />
Bend when you can, snap when you have to <br />
Dear reader <br />
You don't have to answer, just 'cause they asked you <br />
(You should find another) <br />
Dear reader <br />
The greatest of luxuries is your secrets <br />
Dear reader <br />
When you aim at the devil make sure you don't miss <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart <br />
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
So I wander through these nights <br />
I prefer hiding in plain sight <br />
My fourth drink in my hand <br />
These desperate prayers of a cursed man <br />
Spilling out to you for free <br />
But darling, darling, please <br />
You wouldn't take my word for it <br />
If you knew who was talking <br />
If you knew where I was walking <br />
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there <br />
Where I pace in my pen and <br />
My friends found friends who care <br />
No one sees when you lose <br />
When you're playing solitaire <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You should find another guiding light <br />
Guiding light <br />
But I shine so bright <br />
You should find another guiding light <br />
Guiding light <br />
But I shine so bright <br />
You should find another <br />
You should find another <br />
Guiding light <br />
But I shine so bright <br />
You should find another <br />
You should find another <br />
</p>
