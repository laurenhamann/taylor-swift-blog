<p className="verse-one">
My knuckles were bruised like violets <br />
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked <br />
Spineless in my tomb of silence <br />
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground <br />
And maybe it was ego swinging <br />
Maybe it was her <br />
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All that bloodshed, crimson clover <br />
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over <br />
My hand was the one you reached for <br />
All throughout the Great War <br />
Always remember <br />
Uh-huh, tears on the letter <br />
I vowed not to cry anymore <br />
If we survived the Great War <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You drew up some good faith treaties <br />
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone <br />
You said I have to trust more freely <br />
But diesel is desire, you were playin' with fire <br />
And maybe it's the past that's talkin' <br />
Screamin' from the crypt <br />
Tellin' me to punish you for things you never did <br />
So I justified it <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All that bloodshed, crimson clover <br />
Uh-huh, the bombs were close and <br />
My hand was the one you reached for <br />
All throughout the Great War <br />
Always remember <br />
Uh-huh, the burning embers <br />
I vowed not to fight anymore <br />
If we survived the Great War <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Uh-huh <br />
Uh-huh <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
It turned into something bigger <br />
Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed<br />
Your finger on my hair pin triggers <br />
Soldier down on that icy ground <br />
Looked up at me with honor and truth <br />
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops <br />
That was the night I nearly lost you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
I really thought I lost you <br />
We can plant a memory garden <br />
Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair <br />
There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair <br />
And we will never go back <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
To that bloodshed, crimson clover <br />
Uh-huh, the worst was over <br />
My hand was the one you reached for <br />
All throughout the Great War <br />
Always remember <br />
Uh-huh, we're burned for better <br />
I vowed I would always be yours <br />
'Cause we survived the Great War <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Uh-huh <br />
Uh-huh <br />
I would always be yours <br />
'Cause we survived the Great War <br />
Uh-huh <br />
I vowed I would always be yours <br />
</p>
