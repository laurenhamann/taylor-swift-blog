<p className="verse-one">
Lock broken <br />
Slur spoken <br />
Wound open <br />
Game token <br />
I didn't know you were keeping count <br />
Rain soaking <br />
Blind hoping <br />
You said I was <br />
Freeloading <br />
I didn't know you were keeping count <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
High infidelity <br />
Put on your records <br />
And regret me <br />
I bent the truth too far tonight <br />
I was dancing around <br />
Dancing around it <br />
High infidelity <br />
Put on your headphones <br />
And burn my city <br />
Your picket fence is sharp as knives <br />
I was dancing around <br />
Dancing around it <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th? <br />
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Storm coming <br />
Good husband <br />
Bad omen <br />
Dragged my feet right down the aisle <br />
At the house lonely <br />
Good money <br />
I'd pay if you'd just know me <br />
Seemed like the right thing at the time <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love <br />
The slowest way is never loving them enough <br />
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th? <br />
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
High infidelity <br />
Put on your records and regret me <br />
I bent the truth too far tonight <br />
I was dancing around <br />
Dancing around it <br />
High infidelity <br />
Put on your headphones and burn my city <br />
Your picket fence is sharp as knives <br />
I was dancing around, dancing around it <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th? <br />
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes? <br />
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love <br />
The slowest way is never loving them enough <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
High infidelity <br />
Put on your records and regret meeting me <br />
I bent the truth too far tonight <br />
I was dancing around <br />
Dancing around it <br />
High infidelity <br />
Put on your headphones and burn my city <br />
Your picket fence is sharp as knives <br />
I was dancing around <br />
Dancing around it <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love <br />
And it's never enough, it's never enough <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Lock broken <br />
Slur spoken <br />
Wound open <br />
Game token <br />
I didn't know you were keeping count <br />
Rain soaking <br />
Blind hoping <br />
You said I was <br />
Freeloading <br />
I didn't know you were keeping count <br />
But oh, you were keeping count <br />
 <br />
 </p>
