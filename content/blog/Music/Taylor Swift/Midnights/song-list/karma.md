<p className="verse-one">
You're talking shit for the hell of it <br />
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant <br />
You're terrified to look down <br />
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare <br />
Of everyone you burned just to get there <br />
It's coming back around <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I keep my side of the street clean <br />
You wouldn't know what I mean <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause karma is my boyfriend <br />
Karma is a god <br />
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend <br />
Karma's a relaxing thought <br />
Aren't you envious that for you it's not? <br />
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat <br />
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me <br />
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat <br />
Me and karma vibe like that <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Spider-boy, king of thieves <br />
Weave your little webs of opacity <br />
My pennies made your crown <br />
Trick me once, trick me twice <br />
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price? <br />
It's coming back around <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I keep my side of the street clean <br />
You wouldn't know what I mean <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause karma is my boyfriend <br />
Karma is a god <br />
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend <br />
Karma's a relaxing thought <br />
Aren't you envious that for you it's not? <br />
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat <br />
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me <br />
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat <br />
Me and karma vibe like that <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Ask me what I learned from all those years <br />
Ask me what I earned from all those tears <br />
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here <br />
(I'm still, I'm still here) <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
'Cause karma is the thunder <br />
Rattling your ground <br />
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter <br />
Karma's gonna track you down <br />
Step by step from town to town <br />
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen <br />
Karma takes all my friends to the summit <br />
Karma is the guy on the screen <br />
Coming straight home to me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (karma is my boyfriend) <br />
Karma is a god <br />
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (weekend) <br />
Karma's a relaxing thought <br />
Aren't you envious that for you it's not? <br />
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat <br />
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me <br />
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat <br />
Me and karma vibe like that <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Karma is my boyfriend <br />
Karma is a god <br />
Karma's a relaxing thought <br />
</p>

## Quote from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t5sBwyL5z8&t=428s">
So, one of the themes about Midnights is how you're feeling in the middle of the night and that can be intense self-hatred, intense self-love. You go through these very polarizing emotions when you're up late at night and your brain just spirals. It can spiral downward, or it can spiral way up, and you can just be really feeling yourself. And "Karma" is, uh, written from a perspective of feeling like, really happy, really proud of the way your life is, feeling like this must be a reward for doing stuff right. And it's a song that I really love becausе I think we all need some of those momеnts, you know, we can't just be beating ourselves up all the time. You have to have these moments where you're like, "You know what? Karma is my boyfriend." And that's it.
