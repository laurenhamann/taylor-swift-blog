<p className="verse-one">
"It only hurts this much right now" <br />
Was what I was thinking the whole time <br />
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out <br />
I'll be getting over you my whole life  <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You know how scared I am of elevators <br />
Never trust it if it rises fast <br />
It can't last <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Uh-oh, I'm falling in love <br />
Oh no, I'm falling in love again <br />
Oh, I'm falling in love <br />
I thought the plane was going down <br />
How'd you turn it right around? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
It only feels this raw right now <br />
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind <br />
Break up, break free, break through, break down <br />
You would break your back to make me break a smile <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You know how much I hate <br />
That everybody just expects me to bounce back <br />
Just like that <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Uh-oh, I'm falling in love <br />
Oh no, I'm falling in love again <br />
Oh, I'm falling in love <br />
I thought the plane was going down <br />
How'd you turn it right around? <br />
Uh-oh, I'm falling in love <br />
Oh no, I'm falling in love again <br />
Oh, I'm falling in love <br />
I thought the plane was going down <br />
How'd you turn it right around? <br />
Uh-oh, I'm falling in love <br />
Oh no, I'm falling in love again <br />
Oh, I'm falling in love <br />
I thought the plane was going down <br />
How'd you turn it right around? <br />
Uh-oh, I'm falling in love <br />
Oh no, I'm falling in love again <br />
Oh, I'm falling in love <br />
I thought the plane was going down <br />
How'd you turn it right around? <br />
(Uh-oh, I'm falling in love) <br />
(Oh no, I'm falling in love again) <br />
</p>
