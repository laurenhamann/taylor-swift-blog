<p className="intro">
(I remember) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Good girl, sad boy <br />
Big city, wrong choices <br />
We had one thing going on <br />
I swear that it was something <br />
'Cause I don't remember who I was before you <br />
Painted all my nights <br />
A color I have searched for since <br />
But one thing after another <br />
Fuckin' situations, circumstances <br />
Miscommunications and I <br />
Have to say <br />
By the way <br />
I just may like some explanations <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Can I ask you a question? <br />
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room <br />
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you <br />
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too? <br />
Then what did you do? <br />
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh <br />
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh <br />
When she said it was too much? <br />
Do you wish you could still touch her? <br />
It's just a question <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise <br />
Did you realize out of time? <br />
She was on your mind <br />
With some dickhead guy <br />
That you saw that night <br />
But you were on something <br />
It was one drink after another <br />
Fuckin' politics and gender roles <br />
And you're not sure and I don't know <br />
Got swept away in the gray <br />
I just may like to have a conversation <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Can I ask you a question? <br />
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room <br />
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you <br />
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too? <br />
Then what did you do? <br />
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh <br />
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh <br />
When she said it was too much? <br />
Do you wish you could still touch her? <br />
It's just a question <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Does it feel like everything's just like second best after that meteor strike? <br />
And what's that that I heard, that you're still with her? <br />
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable <br />
And right <br />
But tonight <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?) <br />
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room? (In a crowded room) <br />
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you (You, making fun of you) <br />
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too? <br />
Then what did you do? <br />
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh <br />
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh <br />
When she said it was too much? <br />
Do you wish you could still touch her? <br />
It's just a question <br />
