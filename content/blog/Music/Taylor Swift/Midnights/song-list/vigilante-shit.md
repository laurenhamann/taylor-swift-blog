<p className="verse-one">
Draw the cat eye, sharp enough to kill a man <br />
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them <br />
Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie <br />
They say looks can kill and I might try <br />
I don't dress for women <br />
I don't dress for men <br />
Lately I've been dressing for revenge <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I don't start it but I can tell you how it ends <br />
Don't get sad, get even <br />
So on the weekends <br />
I don't dress for friends <br />
Lately I've been dressing for revenge <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
She needed cold hard proof so I gave her some <br />
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from? <br />
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride <br />
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife <br />
And she looks so pretty <br />
Driving in your Benz <br />
Lately she's been dressing for revenge <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
She don't start it, but she can tell you how it ends <br />
Don't get sad, get even <br />
So on the weekends <br />
She don't dress for friends <br />
Lately she's been dressing for revenge <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Ladies always rise above <br />
Ladies know what people want <br />
Someone sweet and kind and fun <br />
The lady simply had enough <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
While he was doing lines <br />
And crossing all of mine <br />
Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI <br />
And I don't dress for villains <br />
Or for innocents <br />
I'm on my vigilante shit again <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I don't start it, but I can tell you how it ends <br />
Don't get sad, get even <br />
So on the weekends <br />
I don't dress for friends <br />
Lately I've been dressing for revenge <br />
</p>
