<p className="verse-one">
Once upon a time, the planets and the fates <br />
And all the stars aligned <br />
You and I ended up in the same room <br />
At the same time <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse <br />
Of a chain reaction of countermoves <br />
To assess the equation of you <br />
Checkmate, I couldn't lose <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What if I told you none of it was accidental <br />
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me? <br />
I laid the groundwork and then, just like clockwork <br />
The dominoes cascaded in a line <br />
What if I told you I'm a mastermind? <br />
And now you're mine <br />
It was all by design <br />
'Cause I'm a mastermind <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You see, all the wisest women <br />
Had to do it this way <br />
'Cause we were born to be the pawn <br />
In every lover's game <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail <br />
Strategy sets the scene for the tale <br />
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails <br />
And the liquor in our cocktails <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What if I told you none of it was accidental <br />
And the first night that you saw me, I knew I wanted your body? <br />
I laid the groundwork and then, just like clockwork <br />
The dominoes cascaded in a line <br />
What if I told you I'm a mastermind? <br />
And now you're mine <br />
It was all my design <br />
'Cause I'm a mastermind <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid <br />
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since <br />
To make them love me and make it seem effortless <br />
This this the first time I've felt the need to confess <br />
And I swear <br />
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So I told you none of it was accidental <br />
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me <br />
I laid the groundwork and then saw a wide smirk <br />
On your face, you knew the entire time <br />
You knew that I'm a mastermind <br />
And now you're mine <br />
Yeah, all you did was smile <br />
'Cause I'm a mastermind <br />
</p>

## Quote from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t5sBwyL5z8&t=512s">
"Mastermind" is a song that I put last on the album because I'm really proud of it and I love that when we were making the song, we wanted the verse to sound like romance, and sort of heroes type of soundtrack, and then we wanted the chorus to sound like a villain has just entered the room. And the idea that you're flipping this narrative and you have been planning and plotting things and making them look like an accident. And I think that that's sort of an inside joke between me and my fans that I t–µnd to do that. And so, this song is the romantic version of that.
