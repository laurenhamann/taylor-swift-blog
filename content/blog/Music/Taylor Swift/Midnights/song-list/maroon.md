<p className="verse-one">
When the morning came we <br />
Were cleaning incense off your <br />
Vinyl shelf 'cause we lost track of time again <br />
Laughing with my feet in your lap <br />
Like you were my closest friend <br />
"How'd we end up on the floor anyway?" <br />
You say <br />
"Your roommate's cheapest screw top ros√© <br />
That's how" <br />
I see you every day now <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I chose you <br />
The one I was dancing with in New York <br />
No shoes <br />
Looked up at the sky and it was <br />
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me <br />
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet it was <br />
The mark they saw on my collarbone <br />
The rust that grew between telephones <br />
The lips I used to call home <br />
So scarlet, it was maroon <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
When the silence came <br />
We were shaking blind and hazy <br />
How the hell did we lose sight of us again? <br />
Sobbing with your head in your hands <br />
Ain't that the way it always ends <br />
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway <br />
Carnations you had thought were roses <br />
That's us <br />
I feel you no matter what <br />
The rubies that I gave up <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I lost you <br />
The one I was dancing with in New York <br />
No shoes <br />
Looked up at the sky and it was (maroon) <br />
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me <br />
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet it
Was (maroon) <br />
The mark they saw on my collarbone <br />
The rust that grew between telephones <br />
The lips I used to call home <br />
So scarlet, it was maroon <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I wake with your memory over me <br />
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy <br />
And I wake with your memory over me <br />
That's a real fucking legacy to leave <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me <br />
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet it
Was (maroon) <br />
The mark they saw on my collarbone <br />
The rust that grew between telephones <br />
The lips I used to call home <br />
So scarlet it was maroon <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
It was maroon <br />
It was maroon <br />
</p>
