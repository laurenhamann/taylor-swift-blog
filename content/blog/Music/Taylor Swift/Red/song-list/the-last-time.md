<p className="verse-one">
Find myself at your door <br />
Just like all those times before <br />
I'm not sure how I got there <br />
All roads, they lead me here <br />
I imagine you are home <br />
In your room, all alone <br />
And you open your eyes into mine <br />
And everything feels better <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And right before your eyes <br />
I'm breaking <br />
No past, no reasons why <br />
Just you and me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is the last time I'm asking you this <br />
Put my name at the top of your list <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you why <br />
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You find yourself at my door <br />
Just like all those times before <br />
You wear your best apology <br />
But I was there to watch you leave <br />
And all the times I let you in <br />
Just for you to go again <br />
Disappear when you come back <br />
Everything is better <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And right before your eyes <br />
I'm aching <br />
Run fast, nowhere to hide <br />
Just you and me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is the last time I'm asking you this <br />
Put my name at the top of your list <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you why <br />
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong <br />
This is the last time I say it's been you all along <br />
This is the last time I let you in my door <br />
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore <br />
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh <br />
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is the last time I'm asking you this <br />
Put my name at the top of your list <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you why <br />
You break my heart in the blink of an eye <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
This is the last time I'm asking you this <br />
(This is the last time I'm asking you this) <br />
Put my name at the top of your list <br />
(Put my name at the top of your list) <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you why <br />
(This is the last time I'm asking you why) <br />
You break my heart in the blink of an eye <br />
(You break my heart) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
This is the last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you this <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you this <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you this <br />
This is the last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you <br />
Last time I'm asking you this <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj1WllQRkxo">
“The Last Time” is a song that I wrote with Gary Lightbody, of Snow Patrol. I’ve always wanted to work with Snow Patrol, they’re my favourite band. This was a song that I wrote about something I had been going through. I picture a door and, on the outside of the door, standing outside in the cold, there’s this guy who’s left his girlfriend over and over again and comes back and asks for a second chance over and over and over again. On the other side of the door, you have this girl standing there with tears in her eyes, wondering how she could possibily turn him away when she loves him this much, but she can’t get hurt again. It’s both of these people swearing that this would be the last time. She’s swearing it’s the last time she’s going to take him back, he’s swearing it’s the last time he’s going to leave her and hurt her. It’s a really intense song and I’m so proud to have Gary on the record. - Taylor Swift
