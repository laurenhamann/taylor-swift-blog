<p className="verse-one">
You said it in a simple way <br />
4:00 a.m. the second day <br />
How strange that I don't know you at all <br />
Stumbled through the long goodbye <br />
One last kiss, then catch your flight <br />
Right when I was just about to fall <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I told myself, don't get attached <br />
But in my mind, I play it back <br />
Spinning faster than the plane that took you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And this is when the feeling sinks in <br />
I don't wanna miss you like this <br />
Come back, be here <br />
Come back, be here <br />
I guess you're in New York today <br />
I don't wanna need you this way <br />
Come back, be here <br />
Come back, be here <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
The delicate beginning rush <br />
The feeling you can know so much <br />
Without knowing anything at all <br />
And now that I can put this down <br />
If I had known what I'd known now <br />
I never would've played so nonchalant <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Taxi cabs and busy streets <br />
That never bring you back to me <br />
I can't help but wish you took me with you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And this is when the feeling sinks in <br />
I don't wanna miss you like this <br />
Come back, be here <br />
Come back, be here <br />
I guess you're in London today <br />
And I don't wanna need you this way <br />
Come back, be here <br />
Come back, be here <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
This is falling in love in the cruelest way <br />
This is falling for you and you are worlds away <br />
In New York, be here <br />
But you're in London, and I break down <br />
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This is when the feeling sinks in <br />
I don't wanna miss you like this <br />
Come back, be here <br />
Come back, be here <br />
I guess you're in New York today <br />
And I don't wanna need you this way <br />
Come back, be here <br />
Come back, be here <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh-oh, oh-oh <br />
I don't wanna miss you like this <br />
Oh-oh, oh-oh <br />
Come back, be here <br />
Come back, be here <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do65k9BEXXs">
It’s a song I wrote about this guy that I met. You know, you meet someone and then they just kinda happen to go away and it’s, like, long distance all of a sudden. And you’re, like, ‘b-b-but, but, come back, be here!’ So it’s a song that I wrote about having distance separate you, which is something I face constantly.
- Taylor Swift
