<p className="verse-one">
It feels like a perfect night <br />
To dress up like hipsters <br />
And make fun of our exes <br />
Ah-ah, ah-ah <br />
It feels like a perfect night <br />
For breakfast at midnight <br />
To fall in love with strangers <br />
Ah-ah, ah-ah <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time <br />
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah <br />
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines <br />
It's time, oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I don't know about you <br />
But I'm feeling 22 <br />
Everything will be alright if <br />
You keep me next to you <br />
You don't know about me <br />
But I'll bet you want to <br />
Everything will be alright if <br />
We just keep dancing like we're 22, 22 <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
It seems like one of those nights <br />
This place is too crowded <br />
Too many cool kids <br />
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew) Ah-ah, ah-ah <br />
It seems like one of those nights <br />
We ditch the whole scene <br />
And end up dreamin' instead of sleeping, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way <br />
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah <br />
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks <br />
It's time, oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I don't know about you <br />
But I'm feeling 22 <br />
Everything will be alright if <br />
You keep me next to you <br />
You don't know about me <br />
But I'll bet you want to <br />
Everything will be alright if <br />
We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh) <br />
22 <br />
I don't know about you <br />
22, 22 <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
It feels like one of those nights <br />
We ditch the whole scene <br />
It feels like one of those nights <br />
We won't be sleeping <br />
It feels like one of those nights <br />
You look like bad news <br />
I gotta have you <br />
I gotta have you <br />
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I don't know about you <br />
But I'm feeling 22 <br />
Everything will be alright if (Ooh) <br />
You keep me next to you <br />
You don't know about me <br />
But I'll bet you want to <br />
Everything will be alright if <br />
We just keep dancing like we're 22 <br />
22 (Dancing like) <br />
22 (Yeah, yeah) <br />
22 (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br />
It feels like one of those nights <br />
We ditch the whole scene <br />
It feels like one of those nights <br />
We won't be sleeping <br />
It feels like one of those nights <br />
You look like bad news <br />
I gotta have you <br />
I gotta have you <br />
</p>

## Quote from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj1WllQRkxo">
The song “22” is kind of an idea I got while I was on a plane, and I ran into the studio with Max Martin and Shellback and I was like, “You guys, listen to this!”, and they loved it too, so we worked on it. I wanted to write a song about what my summer had been like, with my friends, with that kind of attitude of like, “We are in our 20s and we don’t know anything and it’s awesome,” it’s kind of fun to embrace that. And, I gotta say, that’s probably one of the biggest choruses on the record. - Taylor Swift
