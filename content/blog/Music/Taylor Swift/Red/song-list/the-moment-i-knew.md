<p className="verse-one">
You should've been there <br />
Should've burst through the door <br />
With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile <br />
And it would've felt like <br />
A million little shining stars had just aligned <br />
And I would've been so happy <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Christmas lights glisten <br />
I've got my eye on the door <br />
Just waiting for you to walk in <br />
But the time is ticking <br />
People ask me how I've been <br />
As I comb back through my memory <br />
How you said you'd be here <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You said you'd be here <br />
And it was like slow motion <br />
Standing there in my party dress <br />
In red lipstick <br />
With no one to impress <br />
And they're all laughing <br />
As I'm looking around the room <br />
But there was one thing missing <br />
And that was the moment I knew <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
And the hours pass by <br />
Now I just wanna be alone <br />
But your close friends always seem to know <br />
When there's something really wrong <br />
So they follow me down the hall <br />
And there in the bathroom <br />
I try not to fall apart <br />
And the sinking feeling starts <br />
As I say hopelessly <br />
"He said he'd be here" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And it was like slow motion <br />
Standing there in my party dress <br />
In red lipstick <br />
With no one to impress <br />
And they're all laughing <br />
And asking me about you <br />
But there was one thing missing (missing, missing) <br />
And that was the moment I knew <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
What do you say, when tears are streaming down your face <br />
In front of everyone you know? <br />
And what do you do when the one who means the most to you <br />
Is the one who didn't show? <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
You should've been here <br />
And I would've been so happy <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And it was like slow motion <br />
Standing there in my party dress <br />
In red lipstick <br />
With no one to impress <br />
And they're all standing around me singing <br />
"Happy birthday to you" <br />
But there was one thing missing <br />
And that was the moment I knew <br />
Ooh, I knew <br />
Ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You called me later <br />
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it" <br />
And I said, "I'm sorry too" <br />
And that was the moment I knew <br />
</p>
