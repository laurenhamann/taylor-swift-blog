<p className="verse-one">
Flashing lights and we <br />
Took a wrong turn and we <br />
Fell down a rabbit hole <br />
 <br />
You held on tight to me <br />
'Cause nothing's as it seems <br />
And spinning out of control <br />
</p>
 <br />
 <p className="pre-chorus">
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things? <br />
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me? <br />
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds? <br />
 <br />
Oh <br />
 <br />
Didn't it all seem new and exciting? <br />
I felt your arms twisting around me <br />
I should have slept with one eye open at night <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
 <br />
We found wonderland <br />
You and I got lost in it <br />
And we pretended it could last forever <br />
Eh <br />
We found wonderland <br />
You and I got lost in it <br />
And life was never worse but never better <br />
Eh eh <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
 <br />
Eh eh eh eh eh <br />
In wonderland <br />
Eh eh eh eh eh <br />
In wonderland <br />
Eh eh eh eh eh <br />
In wonderland <br />
Eh eh eh eh eh <br />
In wonderland <br />
 <br />
 </p>
 <p className="verse-two">
So we went on our way <br />
Too in love to think straight <br />
All alone or so it seemed <br />
 <br />
But there were strangers watching <br />
And whispers turned to talking <br />
And talking turned to screams <br />
 <br />
Oh <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
 <br />
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things? <br />
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me? <br />
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile? <br />
 <br />
Oh <br />
 <br />
Didn't it all seem new and exciting? <br />
I felt your arms twisting around me <br />
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind <br />
 <br />
But darling,
</p>
<p className="chorus">
we found wonderland <br />
You and I got lost in it <br />
And we pretended it could last forever <br />
Eh <br />
We found wonderland <br />
You and I got lost in it <br />
And life was never worse but never better <br />
Eh eh <br />
</p>
 <br />
 <p className="post-chorus">
Eh eh eh eh eh <br />
In wonderland <br />
Eh eh eh eh eh <br />
In wonderland <br />
Eh eh eh eh eh <br />
In wonderland <br />
Eh eh eh eh eh <br />
In wonderland <br />
 <br />
 </p>
 <p className="bridge">
I reached for you but you were gone <br />
I knew I had to go back home <br />
You searched the world for something else to make you feel like what we had <br />
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
 <br />
Oh <br />
 <br />
We found wonderland <br />
You and I got lost in it <br />
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever) <br />
Eh eh <br />
We found wonderland <br />
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it) <br />
And life was never worse but never better (never better) <br />
Eh eh <br />
 <br />
We found wonderland <br />
You and I got lost in it (wonderland) <br />
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland) <br />
 <br />
We found wonderland <br />
You and I got lost in it (wonderland) <br />
And life was never worse but never better <br />
In wonderland <br />
