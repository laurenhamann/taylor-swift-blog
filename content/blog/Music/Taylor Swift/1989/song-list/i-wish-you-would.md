<p className="verse-one">
It's 2 A.M. in your car <br />
Windows down, I pass my street <br />
The memories start <br />
You say it's in the past <br />
And drive straight ahead <br />
You think I'm gonna hate you now <br />
'Cause you still don't know what I never said <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wish you would come back <br />
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did <br />
I wish you knew that <br />
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
It's 2 A.M. in my room <br />
Headlights pass the window pane <br />
I think of you <br />
We're a crooked love <br />
In a straight line down <br />
Makes you wanna run and hide <br />
Then it makes you turn right back around <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wish you would come back <br />
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did <br />
I wish you knew that <br />
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />
I wish we could go back <br />
And remember what we were fighting for <br />
Wish you knew that <br />
I miss you too much to be mad anymore <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I <br />
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I <br />
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
You gave me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
Stand back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I wish, I wish, I) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
2 A.M., here we are <br />
See your face <br />
Hear my voice in the dark <br />
We're a crooked love <br />
In a straight line down <br />
Guess you wanna run and hide <br />
But it made us turn right back around <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wish you would come back <br />
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did <br />
I wish you knew that <br />
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />
I wish you would come back <br />
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did <br />
I wish you knew that <br />
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />
I wish we could go back <br />
And remember what we were fighting for <br />
Wish you knew that <br />
I miss you too much to be mad anymore <br />
And I wish you were right here, right now <br />
It's all good <br />
I wish you would <br />

I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I) <br />
(I wish you would, I wish you would) <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-i-wish-you-would-voice-memo-lyrics">
This is another way I’ve written songs recently. This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ‘I made this amazing track the other day. It’s so cool, I love these guitar sounds.’ And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ‘Please, please let me have that. Let me play with is, send it to me.’ And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called “I Wish You Would”, because Jack wrote back and said ‘I love that’. So this is another way of writing, it’s writing to track:
