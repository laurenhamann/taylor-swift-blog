Looking at it now <br />
It all seems so simple <br />
We were lying on your couch <br />
I remember <br />
You took a Polaroid of us <br />
Then discovered <br />
(Then discovered) <br />
The rest of the world was black and white <br />
But we were in screaming color <br />
And I remember thinking <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
In the clear yet, good <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
In the clear yet, good <br />
(Are we out of the woods?) <br />

Looking at it now <br />
Last December <br />
(Last December) <br />
We were built to fall apart <br />
Then fall back together <br />
(Back together) <br />
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck <br />
The night we couldn't quite forget <br />
When we decided, we decided <br />
To move the furniture so we could dance <br />
Baby, like we stood a chance <br />
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying <br />
And I remember thinking <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
In the clear yet, good <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
In the clear yet, good <br />
(Are we out of the woods?) <br />

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon? <br />
Twenty stitches in a hospital room <br />
When you started crying, baby, I did too <br />
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you <br />
Remember when we couldn't take the heat? <br />
I walked out, I said "I'm setting you free" <br />
But the monsters turned out to be just trees <br />
When the sun came up you were looking at me <br />
You were looking at me, oh <br />
You were looking at me <br />
(Are we out of the woods yet?) <br />
(Are we out of the woods yet?) <br />
(Are we out of the woods yet?) <br />
(Are we out of the woods?) <br />
I remember <br />
(Are we in the clear yet?) <br />
(Are we in the clear yet?) <br />
Oh, I remember <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah) <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? <br />
In the clear yet, good <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods yet? <br />
Are we out of the woods? <br />
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="">
It kind of conjured up all these feelings of anxiety I had in a relationship where everybody was watching, everybody was commenting on it. You’re constantly just feeling like, ‘Are we out of the woods yet? What’s the next thing gonna be? What’s the next hurdle we’re gonna have to jump over? Are we gonna make it to next week?’ It was interesting to write about a relationship where you’re just honestly like, ‘This is probably not gonna last, but how long is it gonna last?’ Those fragile relationships … It doesn’t mean they’re not supposed to happen. The whole time we were having happy memories or crazy memories or ridiculously anxious times, in my head it was just like, ‘Are we OK yet? Are we there yet? Are we out of this yet?’ 
<br />
