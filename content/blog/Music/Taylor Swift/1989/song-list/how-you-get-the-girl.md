<p className="verse-one">
Stand there like a ghost <br />
Shaking come the rain, rain <br />
She'll open up the door <br />
And say, are you insane, -ane? <br />
Say it's been a long six months (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) <br />
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And that's how it works <br />
That's how you get the girl <br />
And then you say <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I want you for worse or for better <br />
I would wait for ever and ever <br />
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together <br />
I would wait for ever and ever <br />
And that's how it works <br />
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh <br />
And that's how it works <br />
That's how you get the girl, girl <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Remind her how it used to be, be <br />
Yeah, with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks <br />
Tell her how you must've lost your mind (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) <br />
When you left her all alone and never told her why, why (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And that's how it works <br />
That's how you lost the girl <br />
And now you say <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I want you for worse or for better <br />
I would wait for ever and ever (ever and ever) <br />
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together <br />
I would wait for ever and ever <br />
And that's how it works <br />
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh <br />
And that's how it works <br />
That's how you get the girl, girl, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And you could know, oh <br />
That I don't want you to go <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
Remind me how it used to be <br />
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks <br />
And say you want me, yeah, yeah <br />
And then you say
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I want you for worse or for better (worse or for better) <br />
I would wait for ever and ever (ever and ever) <br />
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together <br />
I would wait for ever and ever (I want you for ever and ever) <br />
And that's how it works <br />
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh <br />
(That's how it works) and that's how it works <br />
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh (get the girl) <br />
and that's how it works <br />
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh <br />
And that's how it works <br />
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
And that's how it works <br />
That's how you got the girl <br />
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
The song ‘How You Get the Girl’ is a song that I wrote about how you get the girl back if you ruined the relationship somehow and she won’t talk to you anymore. Like, if you broke up with her and left her on her own for six months and then you realize you miss her. All the steps you have to do to edge your way back into her life, because she’s probably pretty mad at you. So it’s kind of a tutorial. If you follow the directions in the song, chances are things will work out. Or you may get a restraining order. - Taylor Swift
