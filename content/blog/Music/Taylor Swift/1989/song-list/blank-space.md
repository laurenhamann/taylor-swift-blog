<p className="verse-one">
Nice to meet you, where you been? <br />
I could show you incredible things <br />
Magic, madness, heaven, sin <br />
Saw you there and I thought <br />
Oh my God, look at that face <br />
You look like my next mistake <br />
Love's a game, wanna play? Ayy <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
New money, suit and tie <br />
I can read you like a magazine <br />
Ain't it funny, rumors fly <br />
And I know you heard about me <br />
So hey, let's be friends <br />
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends <br />
Grab your passport and my hand <br />
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So it's gonna be forever <br />
Or it's gonna go down in flames <br />
You can tell me when it's over, mm <br />
If the high was worth the pain <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane <br />
'Cause you know I love the players <br />
And you love the game <br />
'Cause we're young and we're reckless <br />
We'll take this way too far <br />
It'll leave you breathless, mm <br />
Or with a nasty scar <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane <br />
But I've got a blank space, baby <br />
And I'll write your name <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Cherry lips, crystal skies <br />
I could show you incredible things <br />
Stolen kisses, pretty lies <br />
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen <br />
Find out what you want <br />
Be that girl for a month <br />
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-four">
Screaming, crying, perfect storms <br />
I can make all the tables turn <br />
Rose garden filled with thorns <br />
Keep you second guessin' like <br />
"Oh my God, who is she?" <br />
I get drunk on jealousy <br />
But you'll come back each time you leave <br />
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So it's gonna be forever <br />
Or it's gonna go down in flames <br />
You can tell me when it's over, mm <br />
If the high was worth the pain <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane <br />
'Cause you know I love the players <br />
And you love the game <br />
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh) <br />
We'll take this way too far <br />
It'll leave you breathless, mm <br />
Or with a nasty scar <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane (insane) <br />
But I've got a blank space, baby <br />
And I'll write your name <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Boys only want love if it's torture <br />
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya <br />
Boys only want love if it's torture <br />
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So it's gonna be forever <br />
Or it's gonna go down in flames <br />
You can tell me when it's over (over), mm <br />
If the high was worth the pain <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane <br />
'Cause you know I love the players <br />
And you love the game <br />
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (yeah) <br />
We'll take this way too far <br />
It'll leave you breathless, mm <br />
Or with a nasty scar <br />
Got a long list of ex lovers <br />
They'll tell you I'm insane <br />
But I've got a blank space, baby <br />
And I'll write your name <br />

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story">
Some of the things I write about on a song like ‘Blank Space’ are satire. You take your creative license and create things that are larger than life. You can write things like ‘I get drunk on jealousy, but you’ll come back each time you leave, ’cause, darling, I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream.’ That is not my approach to relationships. But is it cool to write the narrative of a girl who’s crazy but seductive but glamorous but nuts but manipulative? That was the character I felt the media had written for me, and for a long time I felt hurt by it. I took it personally. But as time went by, I realized it was kind of hilarious.
