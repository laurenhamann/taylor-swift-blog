<p className="verse-one">
It'll be a Wednesday <br />
And I'll be goin' to this coffee shop <br />
Hear the barista call an oat milk latte and your name <br />
And I look up from my phone <br />
And think there's no chance it's you, but it is <br />
You'll say, "Hi," I'll say, "Hi, how are you?" <br />
You'll say, "How's your family? How's your sister?" <br />
I'll say, "Shannon's bein' Shannon" <br />
After a minute of nonsensical chatter, you'll say <br />
"Well, this was really nice, maybe we should do this on purpose sometime" <br />
And it'll have been long enough that we won't harp on (Hmm) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Arguments in your garage <br />
All the ways we sabotaged it (Mmm) <br />
What it was and what it wasn't <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff <br />
I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship <br />
It'd be so nice, right? Right? <br />
If we could take it all off and just exist <br />
And skinny dip in water under the bridge <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You'll suggest a restaurant we used to go to <br />
And I'll say, "Won't that be too nostalgic?" <br />
And you'll say, "Maybe, but let's do it anyway <br />
We won't sit at our same old table, I promise <br />
And we won't bring up the past, we'll keep it bureaucratic" <br />
And we won't say it, but both of us, we'll be thinkin' about <br />
How different we are from those scared little kids that had those (Hmm) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Arguments in your garage <br />
All the ways we sabotaged it (Mmm) <br />
What it was and what it wasn't <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff <br />
I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship<br />
It'd be so nice, right? Right? <br />
If we could take it all off and just exist <br />
And skinny dip in water under the bridge <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha <br />
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha <br />
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha <br />
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha <br />

</p>
<p className="outro">
We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff <br />
I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship <br />
It'd be so nice, right? Right <br />
If we could take it all off and just exist <br />
And skinny dip in water under the bridge <br />

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
"I didn’t feel in that moment that I was at a place where I could literally be skinny dipping in water under the bridge,” <br /> Sabrina tells Teen Vogue.  <br />“I didn’t feel like I was healed and fully out of a place where I didn’t hold any anger or resentment.”  <br />Instead, writing with collaborators Julia Michaels and JP Saxe, she dreamed up a scenario where she had worked through those feelings.
