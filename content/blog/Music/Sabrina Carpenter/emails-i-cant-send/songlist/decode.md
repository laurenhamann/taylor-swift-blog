<p className="verse-one">
You're good at the fallin', not the stayin' there<br />
You're good at the givin' too much, then gettin' scared <br />
You're good at impersonating someone who cares<br />
And you had me for a minute there <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But now I wonder why <br />
I let your confusion keep me up at night <br />
I'm so tired <br />
Reread every single undertone and I <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Overanalyzed it <br />
Front, back, and beside it <br />
Where else can we go? <br />
There's nothin' left here to decode <br />
Done lookin' for signs in <br />
The gaps and the silence <br />
It's just gettin' old <br />
There's nothin' left here to decode <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Mm, mm-mm <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
There's a weight off my shoulders now that I don't chase you <br />
Bein' myself, did that emasculate you? <br />
Learnin' from you that I can walk away too <br />
And you had me for a minute too <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But now I wonder why <br />
I let your indecision keep me up at night <br />
I'm so tired <br />
Unpacked every single word you wrote and I <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Overanalyzed it <br />
Front, back, and beside it <br />
Where else can we go? <br />
There's nothin' left here to decode <br />
Done lookin' for signs in <br />
The gaps and the silence <br />
It's just gettin' old <br />
There's nothin' left here to decode <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Mm, mm-mm <br />
There's nothin' left here to decode <br />
Mm, mm-mm <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Now I wonder why <br />
I let your confusion keep me up at night <br />
I'm so tired <br />
Reread every single undertone and I <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Overanalyzed it <br />
Front, back, and beside it <br />
Where else can we go? <br />
There's nothin' left here to decode <br />
Done lookin' for signs in <br />
The gaps and the silence <br />
It's just gettin' old <br />
There's nothin' left here to decode <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
There's nothin', there's nothin', there's nothin' (Mm, mm-mm) <br />
There's nothin' left here to decode <br />
There's nothin', there's nothin', there's nothin' (No, mm) <br />
There's nothin' left here to decode <br />

I wanna make a video to our future selves <br />

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
This one took the longest to get right. <br />
 At this age, it’s really, really hard to accept anything that’s out of your control, at least for me, to be like, “Why can’t it just be the way that I want it to be in my head?” <br /> Being hard on myself and blaming myself for the entirety of the situation that I was going through.<br /> It’s so funny listening to this song now. <br />I’m literally gonna cry.<br /> I hope for the rest of my life, I can use this song as a compass to guide me: “You are past the point of asking questions and asking Whys and asking Hows.<br /> It just is what it is.”<br /> Sometimes you need to just accept that statement.<br />
There’s a lot of power in being like, “I’m not going to look back anymore, I’m not going to question and I’m not going to wonder why.<br /> I’m just gonna allow it to be what it was and know that it was meant to happen.”<br /> - <b>Sabrina Carpenter</b>
