<p className="verse-one">
Oh, so you do have a type and it's not me <br />
Oh, so you can reply, just to not me <br />
If you wanted brown eyes <br />
I coulda got contacts <br />
So y'all are in Paris now, guess it's public <br />
Face like that other girl you're in love with <br />
You knew I would see that <br />
You knew I would notice <br />

</p>

<p className="chorus">
She looks nothing like me <br />
Can't really tell, should I be <br />
Tryna take it as a compliment? <br />
It's kinda feelin' like the opposite <br />
She looks nothing like me <br />
So why do you look so happy? <br />
Now I think I get the cause of it <br />
You were holdin' out to find the opposite <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
And I know now <br />
Even if I tried to change <br />
That somehow <br />
You'd end up with her anyway <br />
Oh, I know now <br />
Even if I tried to change <br />
That somehow <br />
You'd end up with her anyway <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Does she say nothin' so you feel good? <br />
Does she step out the spotlight so you bathe in it? <br />
Does she get up on top of you more than I would? <br />
Does she just love the picture 'cause you're paintin' it? (Mm) <br />
I care, but I don't <br />
Just wonderin', when you (When you) <br />
Said I'm beautiful <br />
Was I bein' lied to? <br />
</p>

Even if I tried to change <br />
That somehow (Somehow) <br />
You'd end up with her anyway (You'd end up with her anyway) <br />

End up with her anyway<br />
