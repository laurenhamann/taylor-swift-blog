<p className="verse">
It's times like these, wish I had a time machine <br />
So I could see what you did October 13th <br />
At 10:15, were you really asleep? <br />
Were you lyin' to me and the family? <br />
There's no "us" in us when I'm lackin' trust <br />
You wanna discuss, ugh, you disgust me <br />
Don't make me cuss you out, why'd you let me down? <br />
Don't say sorry now <br />
And thanks to you, I, I can't love right <br />
I get nice guys and villainize them <br />
Read their texts like they're havin' sex right now <br />
Scared I'll find out that it's true <br />
And if I do, then I blame you <br />
For every worst that I assume <br />
When I'm forty-five, someone calls me their wife <br />
And he fucks our lives in one selfish night <br />
Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did <br />
And God, I love you, but you're such a dipshit <br />
Please fuckin' fix this <br />
'Cause you were all I looked up to <br />
Now I can't even look at you <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
(You too) <br />
I mean, as they say in Chicago <br />
"He had it comin'" <br />
</p>
