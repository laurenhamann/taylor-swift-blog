<p className="verse-one">
Told me, told me I'm your only <br />
It's all unfoldin', babe<br />
Slowly, slowly, lies you sold me<br />
All saw the light of day<br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You been wastin' time on the other side<br />
If you're satisfied, touché<br />
Now you say you hate all the empty space<br />
And if you could go back, you'd stay<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Didn't think about it when you let me down<br />
Hurts to see me outta your reach<br />
Bet you wanna touch me now<br />
It's cold out there, let me know what you found<br />
(Let me know what you found)<br />
Bet you wanna love me now<br />
Bet you wanna love me now<br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Chase me, chase me, that's right, baby<br />
Yeah, feel the way it feels<br />
When you don't have control of who I'm holdin'<br />
Is it feedin' all your fears?<br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You been wastin' time on the other side<br />
If you're satisfied, touché<br />
But the lights are off, your so-called friends are gone<br />
Oh, I know what you're 'bout to say<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Didn't think about it when you let me down<br />
Hurts to see me outta your reach<br />
Bet you wanna touch me now<br />
It's cold out there, let me know what you found<br />
(Let me know what you found)<br />
Bet you wanna love me now<br />
Bet you wanna love me now<br />
Didn't think about it when you let me down<br />
Hurts to see me outta your reach<br />
Bet you wanna touch me now<br />
It's cold out there, let me know what you found<br />
(Let me know what you found)<br />
Bet you wanna love me now<br />
Bet you wanna love me now<br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I bet you wanna<br />
I bet you wanna (Ah)<br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Bet you miss me, bet you're reminiscin'<br />
I bet you hate the way that you said goodbye<br />
And you still can't even tell me why<br />
I hate the way that you left me dry<br />
But I'll keep that between you and I<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I bet you didn't think about it when you let me down<br />
Hurts to see me outta your reach<br />
Bet you wanna touch me now (Oh, touch me now)<br />
It's cold out there, let me know what you found<br />
Bet you wanna love me now (Uh-huh)<br />
Bet you wanna love me now<br />
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
I saw this theme and it happened a lot – I was <br />like ‘They always come back when you don’t need <br />them anymore’. So, this is a song about that.<br />
- Sabrina Carpenter
