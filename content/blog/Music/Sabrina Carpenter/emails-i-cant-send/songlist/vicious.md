<p className="verse-one">
One year, ten thousand bad moments <br />
But it was dressed up in heated emotion <br />
And I tried to look for the best in the worst <br />
But like, fuck me, that caused a commotion <br />
You're lucky I'm a private person <br />
I've quietly carried your burden <br />
And everyone thinks you're an angel <br />
But shit, I would probably use different wordin' <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, you're so vicious <br />
Love me, then pretend you didn't <br />
Crush my heart and wreck my image <br />
Why you gotta be so vicious? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You like a certain type of woman <br />
Who's smart, but neglects intuition <br />
When you're insecure, could be me, could be her <br />
You just run to whoever is winnin' (Ah) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Said that it was me and you for life <br />
Now you're kinda acting like I died <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, you're so vicious <br />
Love me, then pretend you didn't <br />
Crush my heart and wreck my image <br />
Why you gotta be so, so, so <br />
Oh, you're so vicious (No) <br />
Love me, then pretend you didn't <br />
Half of me just can't resist it <br />
Why you gotta be so vicious? <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Oh, no <br />
Why you gotta be so <br />
Oh, oh <br />
Why you gotta be so vicious? <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You don't feel remorse, you don't feel the effects <br />
'Cause you don't think you hurt me if you wish me the best <br />
I shoulda known all along, I was only the next one <br />
To take your love songs as a promise <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, you're so vicious <br />
I loved you, but I wish I didn't <br />
If you're out there somewhere listenin' <br />
Why you gotta be so vicious? <br />
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
I wanted to write a song that felt super-personal and kinda take you through all these emotions that you feel when you separate from someone that you were really close to.  <br /> They donâ€™t feel like someone you know anymore, and they become kind of like a stranger.

<b>- Sabrina Carpenter</b>
