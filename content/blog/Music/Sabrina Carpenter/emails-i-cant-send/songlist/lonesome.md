<p className="verse-one">
If I fall in love with all my problems, will they leave me too? <br />
Or maybe I believed in all your lies 'cause I believed in you <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Why were you somewhere else when you were next to me? <br />
I know you know it keeps me up <br />
Did you think about her face with your hands around my waist? <br />
Did you even give a fuck? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You can't spell "lonesome" without "me" <br />
Mm, mm, mm <br />
And there's no hope in misery <br />
Mm, mm, mm <br />
I can't escape your history, oh <br />
You can't spell "lonesome" without "me" <br />
You just can't <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Tell me I was more than just a decent opportunity <br />
Or will you tell me anything I wanna hear to  <br /> control how you're perceived? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Why were you somewhere else when you were next to me? <br />
I know you know it keeps me up <br />
Isn't it kind of strange how it all changed when <br />
I wasn't the one they wanted you to love? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You can't spell "lonesome" without "me" <br />
Mm, mm, mm <br />
And there's no hope in misery <br />
Mm, mm, mm <br />
I can't escape your history, oh <br />
You can't spell "lonesome" without "me" <br />
You just can't <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Mm, mm <br />
Mm, mm, mm <br />
Mm, mm <br />
Mm, mm, mm <br />
</p>
