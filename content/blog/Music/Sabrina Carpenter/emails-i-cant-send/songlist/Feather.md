<p className="intro">
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) <br />
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) <br />
Oh, not another take <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Oh, it's like that, I'm your dream come true <br />
When it's on a platter for you <br />
Then you pull back when I try to make plans <br />
More than two hours in advance, mm <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I slam the door, I hit ignore <br />
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more" <br />
I got you blocked, after this, an afterthought <br />
I finally cut you off <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind (Ah) <br />
Floatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time (Ah) <br />
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch <br />
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic" <br />
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life <br />
With you out my life <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) <br />
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) <br />
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
It feels so good <br />
Not carin' where you are tonight <br />
And it feels so good <br />
Not pretendin' to like the wine you like <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I slam the door (Slam the door), I hit ignore (Hit ignore) <br />
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more" <br />
I got you blocked, excited to never talk, I <br />
I'm so sorry for your loss <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind (Ah) <br />
Floatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time (Ah) <br />
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch (A bitch) <br />
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic" <br />
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life <br />
With you out my life <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) <br />
Ah, mm <br />
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do) <br />
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You want me? I'm done <br />
You miss me? No duh <br />
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at <br />
You want me? I'm done (I'm done) <br />
You miss me? No duh (No duh) <br />
Where I'm at, I'm up (I'm up) where I'm at <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You want me? I'm done <br />
(I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind) <br />
You miss me? No duh <br />
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at <br />
(Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather) <br />
You want me? I'm done <br />
(I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind) <br />
You miss me? No duh <br />
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at <br />
(Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah) <br />
