<p className="intro">
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh, la-la) <br />
Da-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah <br />
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh <br />
Yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Think I only want one number in my phone <br />
I might change your contact to "Don't Leave Me Alone" <br />
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll <br />
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But I can't help myself when you get close to me <br />
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like  <br />"bleh-blah-blee"<br />
I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep <br />
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me (Me) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'll be honest <br />
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense <br />
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in <br />
And when you got your arms around me <br />
Oh, it feels so good <br />
I had to jump the octave <br />
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him <br />
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it <br />
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense <br />
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I'm talkin' all around the clock <br />
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks <br />
I'm talkin' opposite of soft <br />
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts <br />
You gotta keep up with me <br />
I got some young energy <br />
I caught the L-O-V-E <br />
How do you do this to me? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But I can't help myself when you get close to me<br />
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-bleh-blee" <br />
And I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep (Too deep) <br />
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'll be honest (Honest)<br />
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense (Nonsense)<br />
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in (When you walk in) <br />
When you got your arms around me<br />
Oh, it feels so good <br />
I had to hit the octave <br />
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him <br />
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it <br />
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense (Oh-oh) <br />
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin' <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Na-na-na), I'm talkin' <br />
(Blah-blah, blah-blah) <br />
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah (Ah-ah) <br />
I don't even know anymore <br />
(Oh) <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
This song catchier than chickenpox is <br />
I bet your house is where my other sock is <br />
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a pop hit, ha-ha <br />
How quickly can you take your clothes off? Pop quiz <br />
That one's not gonna make it <br />
Most of these aren't gonna make <br />
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
Genuinely, [I] just could not stop writing fake versions of the chorus. <br />
[…] Basically, we were, like, we know the song is nonsense, we know the chorus, so we took a few of those lyrics that we love, that we were dying over, and we put them in the outro of the song. <br />
It’s cool that that kinda song was able to make it in the record, because I really think that also it shows my stupid sense of humor. <br />

Some days are amazing, fun and happy and, you know, you feel really good about yourself, and others days you feel the lowest you ever felt, so “Nonsense” to me, I was, like “I just wonder if it kinda discredits the rest of the album by how like upbeat it is and how fun and careless it is,” but now I feel like is part of it, so I’m very happy I had it. <br />
