<p className="verse-one">
We been talkin' for hours <br />
'Bout how we shouldn't talk for hours on end <br />
Kissin' after a conversation <br />
'Bout how we'd probably be better off as friends <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Same time here next weekend <br />
Say we won't do this again <br />
Make me fall where I stand <br />
Only like you can <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Yeah, I say I'm done, but I'm still confused <br />
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure? <br />
And I change my mind, but it's still on you <br />
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over? <br />
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Selfishly don't wanna give you <br />
Time to be on someone else's lips (Ah) <br />
But I'll take three short hours over <br />
Three long weeks pretendin' like we don't exist, hmm  <br />(Ah) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Same time here next weekend <br />
Say we won't do this again <br />
Make me fall where I stand <br />
Only like you can<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Yeah, I say I'm done, but I'm still confused <br />
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure? <br />
And I change my mind, but it's still on you <br />
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over? <br />
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over? <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
After the aftermath, I know you'll be comin' back <br />
To the back bedroom and it won't be the last<br />
Of the aftermath, I know you'll be comin' back <br />
To the back bedroom and it won't be the last time <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I say I'm done, but I'm still confused <br />
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure? (Ooh)<br />
And I change my mind, but it's still on you<br />
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?<br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Yeah, I like my bed, but it likes you too<br />
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?<br />

## Quotes from Artists

<blockquote>
This one happened from a game<br />
 we were playing in the studio.<br /> It was the end of a long week and we were really tired.<br /> We split into groups of two<br /> and each of us wrote a chorus in 15 minutes,<br /> and we’ll rotate so by the end of the hour we’ll have six chorus ideas.<br /> If we like any of them, great, we can start that tomorrow<br /> and if not, we don’t have to use any of them, it’s fine. <br />I teamed up with John Ryan, who produced the song.<br /> We wrote this slow, Beatles-y-sounding song called “Closure.”<br /> And it’s a different melody, but the lyric was “How am I supposed to leave you now that I know you’re already over?”<br /> I have this feeling where sometimes I can’t leave my own house.<br /> So if you’re here, like,<br /> what am I supposed to do?<br /> You’re already here, it’s too late.<br />
<b>- Sabrina Carpenter</b>
