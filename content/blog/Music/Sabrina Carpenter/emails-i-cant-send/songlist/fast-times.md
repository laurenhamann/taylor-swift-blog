<p className="verse-one">
Sun's up too soon like daylight savings <br />
Mixed emotions are congregating <br />
Picturin' us in all these places <br />
Ahead of myself's an understatement <br />
Sky looks so purple, I can taste it <br />
Couple days in, I call you "baby" <br />
Three stories up here contemplatin' <br />
But what the fuck is patience? <br />

</p>

<p className="chorus">
These are fast times and fast nights, yeah <br />
No time for rewrites, we couldn't help it <br />
Outlines on bed sides, yeah <br />
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it <br />
Fast times and fast nights, yeah <br />
Closed eyes and closed blinds, we couldn't help it <br />
Outlines on bed sides, yeah <br />
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it<br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
My feelings used to be serrated <br />
But you speak in such a perfect cadence <br />
Tiptoeing past so many stages <br />
But what the fuck is patience? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
These are fast times and fast nights, yeah <br />
No time for rewrites, we couldn't help it <br />
Outlines on bed sides, yeah <br />
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it <br />
Fast times and fast nights, yeah <br />
Closed eyes and closed blinds, we couldn't help it <br />
Outlines on bed sides, yeah <br />
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
These, these are <br />
These are the fast times <br />
These, these are <br />
These are the— <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Fast times and fast nights, yeah (Yeah) <br />
No time for rewrites, we couldn't help it <br />
Outlines on bed sides, yeah (Yeah) <br />
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it <br />
Fast times and fast nights, yeah <br />
Closed eyes and closed blinds, we couldn't help it <br />
Outlines on bed sides, yeah <br />
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it <br />

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
We weren’t taking ourselves too seriously making it, which really reflects the energy of the song. <br /> [It’s] really about the feeling when you’re letting life steer the wheel and you think ‘Let me enjoy this now and I’ll process the emotional repercussions of this later.‘ <br /> [It’s] very indicative of my 20s thus far.<br />
<b>- Sabrina Carpenter</b>
