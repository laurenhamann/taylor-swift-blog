<p className="verse-one">
"Baby, sorry I left you in the dark" <br />
"I always reach for your leg over there on your side of the car" <br />
"Baby, everything reminds me of you" <br />
"Nobody gets my jokes, everyone here thinks I'm fuckin' rude" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
"When I saw you cry, I didn't handle it well" <br />
"Without you here, I don't know what to do with myself" <br />
I think about these things at night before I fall asleep <br />
Things I wish you said to me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Things like, "Darlin', I hope you know it scared me to death <br />
The night that your sister said that you got in an accident" <br />
"And God, I, I'm watchin' everything that you do" <br />
"I can't get your songs out of my head or your hair out of my room" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
"I saw you met somebody and I'm jealous as hell <br />
That I can't even stomach lovin' somebody else" <br />
I think about these things at night before I fall asleep <br />
Things I wish you said to me <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Ooh <br />
Ooh, ah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
"Sorry that I pulled the 'it's not you, it's me'" <br />
"One day, I'll make sure you get a real apology" <br />
I waste my time, I waste my life on idiotic things <br />
Like things you never said <br />
Things you'll never say to me<br />
</p>
