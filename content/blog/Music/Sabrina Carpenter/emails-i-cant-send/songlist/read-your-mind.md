<p className="intro">
Ah <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Made it clear when you told me (Ah-ah) <br />
Don't know why, but you gotta be lonely (Ah-ah-ah) <br />
Say it's hard, but you make it look easy (Ah-ah) <br />
So I'm tryin' to live in reality (Ah-ah-ah-ah) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Decompressin', tryna ease the tension, but you <br />
Got me stressin', feelin' like I need to call when<br />
You sneak up on me, tell me that you miss me in your life <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I can't read your mind <br />
You say that you need to be alone <br />
But night and day, want me at your beck and call <br />
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line <br />
Wastin' all our time <br />
To think that we could be casual <br />
You're not my friend and, baby, you never were <br />
Why the fuss if you say you just wanna be mine? <br />
I can't read your mind <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Tell me, what's gonna happen <br />
When it's you and me in a room, but you know you can't have it? <br />
Oh, I'll be laughin' <br />
When you say that you really have changed <br />
Finally found your way <br />
'Cause I'm close to your face (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Double-checkin', did I get the message in the way <br />
You intended? Got me second-guessin' when you <br />
Sneak up on me, tell me that you need me in your life <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I can't read your mind <br />
You say that you need to be alone <br />
But night and day, want me at your beck and call <br />
You say (Uh) you know (Yeah) that you might be crossin' a line <br />
Wastin' all our time <br />
To think that we could be casual <br />
You're not my friend and, baby, you never were <br />
Why the fuss if you say you just wanna be mine? <br />
I can't read your mind <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You say that you need to be alone <br />
But night and day, want me at your beck and call <br />
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I can't read your mind<br />
You say that you need to be alone<br />
But night and day, want me at your beck and call (Want me at your beck and call)<br />
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line
Wastin' all our time (Time) <br />
To think (Think) that we could be casual<br />
You're not (Not) my friend (My friend) and, baby, you never were <br />
Why (Why) the fuss (Fuss) if you say you just wanna be mine? <br />
I can't read your mind <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Ha-ah-ah-ah, la, mm-mm <br />
