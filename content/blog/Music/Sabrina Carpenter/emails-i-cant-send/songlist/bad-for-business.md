<p className="chorus">
He's good for my heart, but he's bad for business <br />
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes <br />
All of my friends think I've gone crazy <br />
But they don't know me like my baby <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
We look good in photographs <br />
I like the way you like to laugh <br />
At dirty jokes, I know they'll always land <br />
Used to get to work on time <br />
But now you're takin' up my nights <br />
Never been so glad to be so tired <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Ooh, I'm mad for you <br />
It's sad but true and I know it <br />
Ah, you're on my mind <br />
You stole my life and it's showin' (Baby) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
He's good for my heart, but he's bad for business <br />
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes <br />
All of my friends think I've gone crazy <br />
But they don't know me like my baby <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
If I'm just writin' happy songs <br />
Will anybody sing along? <br />
You had to go and break into my head <br />
And I would try to fight these feelings <br />
I can't find a single reason <br />
I'd make all the same mistakes again, ah <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Ooh, I'm mad for you <br />
It's sad but true and I know it <br />
Ah, you're on my mind <br />
You stole my life and it's showin' <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
He's good for my heart, but he's bad for  business <br />
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes <br />
All of my friends think I've gone crazy <br />
But they don't know me like my baby <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
He's good (Good), it's bad (Bad) <br />
The best I've ever had (Best I've ever had) <br />
And he's so nice, it's sad (It's sad) <br />
He ruined all my plans <br />
And he just makes me so crazy <br />
I know everyone sees <br />
That he'll be the death of me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
He's good for my heart, but he's bad for business<br /> (He's very bad for business)<br />
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes <br />
All of my friends think I've gone crazy <br />
But they don't know me like my baby <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
He's good for my heart, but he's bad for business (So bad) <br />
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes <br />
All of my friends think I've gone crazy <br />
But they don't know me like my baby <br />
</p>
