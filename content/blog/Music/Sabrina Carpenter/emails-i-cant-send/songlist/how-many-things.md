<p className="verse-one">
You used a fork once <br />
It turns out forks are fuckin' everywhere <br />
There's no hiding from the thought of us <br />
I got ways to find you anywhere <br />
We sat on the roof once <br />
Conversation took us everywhere <br />
And we talked until the sun came up <br />
I wish we stayed just like we were up there <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I consider you, I'm not trying to <br />
It doesn't matter whether not I want to <br />
I can't help it, it's a habit <br />
Your corner in my mind is well-established <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I, I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me <br />
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think  <br />I'm in-between<br />
I feel myself fallin' further down your priorities <br />
And I still make excuses for you constantly <br />
I wonder how many things you think about <br />
Before, before you get to me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Remember when you left once? <br />
That never made too much sense to me <br />
Well, it hurt you so bad hurting me <br />
You really came to me for sympathy<br />
</p> 
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh, I consider you and I'm not trying to <br />
It doesn't matter whether not I want to <br />
I can't help it, it's a habit <br />
Your corner in my mind is well-established <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I, I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me <br />
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I'm in-between <br />
And I feel myself falling further down your priorities <br />
And I still make excuses for you constantly <br />
I wonder how many things you think about <br />
Before, before you get to me <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Am I not even a second thought? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me <br />
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I'm in-between <br />
I feel myself fallin' further down your priorities <br />
And I still make excuses for you constantly <br />
I wonder how many things you think about <br />
Before, before you get to me <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Wonder how many things <br />
