<p className="verse-one">
I said I wanted Thin Mints and you said you knew a guy <br />
You showed up with a boombox and stars in your eyes <br />
Who knew cuddling on trampolines could be so reckless? <br />
We bonded over Black Eyed Peas and complicated exes <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Fell so deeply into it <br />
It was all so innocent <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut <br />
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks <br />
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice <br />
All because I liked <br />
I'm the hot topic on your tongue <br />
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young <br />
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice <br />
All because I liked a boy <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I'm not catastrophizing, everything's derailing <br />
Was only tryna hold you close while your heart was failing <br />
It's not internet illusion, just two kids going through it <br />
You said I'm too late to be your first love, <br /> but I'll always be your favorite <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut <br />
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks <br />
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice <br />
All because I liked <br />
I'm the hot topic on your tongue <br />
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young <br />
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice <br />
All because I liked a boy <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Ah <br />
Ah <br />
Ah <br />
All because I liked a boy <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Fell so deeply into it <br />
It was all so innocent <br />
Dating boys with exes <br />
No, I wouldn't recommend it <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut <br />
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks <br />
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice <br />
All because I liked a boy <br />
And all of this for what? <br />
When everything went down, we'd already broken up <br />
Please tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice <br />
All because I liked a boy <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Ah (A boy) <br />
Ah (A boy) <br />
Ah <br />
All because I liked a boy <br />
</p>

## Quotes from Artists

<blockquote>
That song came from a really real place in my life, <br /> 
so it didn’t feel right to not kind of write that song, <br />
but at the same time, <br /> 
I’ve had so many people that have heard it tell me <br />
how much they relate to it in their own way. <br /> 
Like, “I went through years where people were believing all these things that people were saying about me that weren’t true.“ <br /> 
People have experienced that similar situation in a completely different way than I’ve experienced it. <br />
It was very therapeutic to write that song from hindsight and being like, <br />  
“Wow, one thing leads to another and things can really get out of hand.” <br /> 
Just being able to own it at the end of the day, <br />
and not let it determine who you are. <br />
My favorite lyric in the song is <em>“Tell me who I am, <br />
because I don’t have a choice.”</em> <br />
It’s obviously sarcastic,<br />
but in the way that people can’t tell you who you are.<br />
Only if you allow them to, like really get under your skin, <br />
but truthfully, you know who you are.
<br />
