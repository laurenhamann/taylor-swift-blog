<p className="verse-one">
We were never in the park <br />
Talkin' on a seesaw teetering with our feelings in the dark <br />
Ignoring tornado warnings <br />
He didn't hold me in his arms <br />
We didn't stumble over the pages of our relationship arc <br />
Ignoring tornado warnings <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Don't understand how quickly we get <br />
Right back in our rhythm without missing a step<br />
And logically the last thing I should have on my mind <br />
But I want you there sometimes <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I guess maybe that's why I'm lying to my therapist <br />
I keep saying things like, "I never saw him and we never kissed" <br />
Now I think somehow in my mind <br />
If I could convince him, if he doesn't see it, then maybe it doesn't exist <br />
I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch <br />
I'm lying to my therapist <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I deserve an hour in a week to focus on my thoughts <br />
Not so obsessed with yours, I can't hear myself speak <br />
I deserve my own consideration, but sometimes, I wish I kept <br />
Some of my feelings in the basement so I'd still have some left <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Don't understand how quickly we get <br />
Right back in our rhythm without missing a step<br />
And logically the last thing I should have on my mind <br />
But I want you there sometimes <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I guess maybe that's why I'm lying to my therapist <br />
I keep saying things like, "I never saw him and we never kissed" <br />
Now I think somehow in my mind <br />
If I could convince him, if he doesn't see it, then maybe it doesn't exist <br />
I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch <br />
I'm lying to my therapist <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I'll drive you home, you drive me crazy <br />
But that's not gonna stop me <br />
I'll call you out, you call me "baby" <br />
But that's not gonna stop me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
From lying to my therapist <br />
I keep saying things like, "I never saw him and we never kissed" <br />
Now I think somehow in my mind <br />
If I could convince him, if he doesn't see it, then maybe it doesn't exist <br />
I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch <br />
I'm lying to my therapist <br />

## Quotes from Artists

<blockquote>
The coolest thing about this story is that it’s so literal.  <br />
Well, both literal and metaphorical, because I use tornado warnings as a metaphor for being in situations where you know it’s probably going to be bad for you, but you decide to ignore them. <br />
But this was based on a true story where I was in the middle of a park on a seesaw with someone that I shouldn’t have been with and then it started to hail and then I got a tornado warning on my phone and ignored it.<br />
 The next day I had therapy, and I completely did not tell my therapist anything because I was afraid that he was going to be mad at me.
 <br />
And I was like, “Why am I spending money on this therapy session if I’m gonna lie to you?”.
<br />
