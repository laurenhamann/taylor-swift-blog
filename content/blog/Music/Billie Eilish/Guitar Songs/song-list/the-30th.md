<p className="verse-one">
Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I
</p>
<p className="bridge">
What if it happened to you on a different day?
On a bridge where there wasn't a rail in the way?
Or a neighborhood street where the little kids play?
Or the Angeles Crest in the snow or the rain?
What if you weren't alone? There were kids in the car
What if you were remote? No one knows where you are
If you changed anything, would you not have survived?
You're alive, you're alive, you're alive
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In your hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so am I
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
That’s why it’s called ‘The 30th,’ because something happened on November 30th and it had just been the most indescribable thing to have to witness and experience. I had been writing down all these thoughts that I was having. I was with Finneas, and I was like, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what you were planning on doing, but we need to write this song about this right now,” and we did, and that was the first song we wrote since Happier Than Ever.
<b>- Billie Eilish</b>
