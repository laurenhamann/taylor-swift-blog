<p className="verse-one">
I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Now all of my friends are missing again
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
And you tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I don't get along with anyone
</p>
<p className="outro">
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
Finneas and I have talked about the fact that we want to be making music and we just haven’t had any time to make music — we were on tour, it was busy, this and that —, and so, we kind of made a little schedule, we were, like, “Okay, well, let’s see if we make anything, if we work today.” When you’re on the road, and especially with the schedule that we had, it was really tough, but we tried, and we ended up writing, I think, the first verse and the chorus […] many months ago now. So, me and Laura come into my green room and I’m, like, “Laura, listen to this song we just wrote,” and it was just the first verse. I play it and Laura is literally sitting there [confused], and I’m, like, “It’s fictional, it’s just fictional, don’t you worry about it.” Then, a couple months went by, things changed, and then we wrote the rest of the song.

In May, I was somewhere and our plane was super late. It was me, my mom and Laura, we were sitting at this house, and I just started looking through my voice memos, because it’s something I do all the time — I have so many, I sometimes record stuff and then forget about it, so it’s really exciting to look through my voice memos and find all these stuff. I started playing “The 30th,” which I love so much, and we were just listening to it, crying together, and it was really sweet. Then, I started playing “TV,” and we actually just finished the song a couple weeks before, and I was sitting there, just thinking out loud, saying, “I want these to come out,” because the whole thing with music, especially when you get bigger, is every drop is this big deal of “We gotta send it in fucking five months before it’s gonna come out, because you have to get vinyls ready, you have to set a date, shoot the video, do the press and shoot for it, the artwork, and this and that,” which is all fine, but it’s been so long since I’ve had music that we make and then it’s out, and it’s been so long since I’ve done a song live that isn’t out.
