<p className="verse-one">
Take me to the rooftop <br />
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing <br />
Turnin' blue <br />
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious <br />
Leave me like you do (Like you do) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If you need me, wanna see me <br />
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Sorry can't save me now <br />
Sorry I don't know how <br />
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry) <br />
But down <br />
Hmm, down <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek <br />
That's what a year-long headache does to you <br />
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered <br />
Don't say I'm all that matters <br />
Leave me, déjà vu (Hmm) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
If you need me, wanna see me <br />
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Sorry can't save me now (Sorry) <br />
Sorry I don't know how (Sorry) <br />
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry) <br />
But down <br />
Hmm, down <br />

</p>
<p className="outro">
Call my friends and tell them that I love them <br />
And I'll miss them <br />
But I'm not sorry <br />
Call my friends and tell them that I love them <br />
And I'll miss them <br />
Sorry <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
Basically it’s like, um it’s about, it’s just about depression, and what can come out of depression, which is not pretty good. […] When this comes out, I don’t want it to break you down, I want it to bring you to me and I don’t know, be like a mental hug, I guess. [… ] What I’m really trying to do is let my words be your words and stay ours.” (She continues to talk about how her fans are the reason she’s who she is, says how much she loves them).

<blockquote>
There’s a really intense bass drop synth in the middle of the song “listen” that I think is so at odds with everything else about the song “listen”, because that song is just really pretty, and there’s this crazy distorted bass that I play on a thing called a seaboard. I think that was probably the biggest shift from wherever we had been before, was these really dark textures and dark sounds.
