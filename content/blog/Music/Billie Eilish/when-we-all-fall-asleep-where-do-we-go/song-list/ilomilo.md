<p className="verse-one">
Told you not to worry <br />
But maybe that's a lie <br />
Honey, what's your hurry? <br />
Won't you stay inside? <br />
Remember not to get too close to stars <br />
They're never gonna give you love like ours <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Where did you go? <br />
I should know, but it's cold <br />
And I don't wanna be lonely <br />
So show me the way home <br />
I can't lose another life <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Hurry, I'm worried <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
The world's a little blurry <br />
Or maybe it's my eyes <br />
The friends I've had to bury <br />
They keep me up at night <br />
Said I couldn't love someone <br />
'Cause I might break <br />
If you're gonna die, not by mistake <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So, where did you go? <br />
I should know, but it's cold <br />
And I don't wanna be lonely <br />
So tell me you'll come home <br />
Even if it's just a lie <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I tried not to upset you <br />
Let you rescue me the day I met you <br />
I just wanted to protect you <br />
But now I'll never get to <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Hurry, I'm worried <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Where did you go? <br />
I should know, but it's cold <br />
And I don't wanna be lonely <br />
Was hoping you'd come home <br />
I don't care if it's a lie <br />
</p>

…The whole idea is the game, it’s just like, losing the person you love and then finding them again.
