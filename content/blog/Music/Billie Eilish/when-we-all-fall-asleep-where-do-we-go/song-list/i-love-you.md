<p className="verse-one">
It's not true <br />
Tell me I've been lied to <br />
Crying isn't like you, ooh <br />
What the hell did I do? <br />
Never been the type to <br />
Let someone see right through, ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Maybe won't you take it back? <br />
Say you were tryna make me laugh <br />
And nothing has to change today <br />
You didn't mean to say "I love you" <br />
I love you and I don't want to, ooh <br />

</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Up all night on another red-eye <br />
I wish we never learned to fly <br />
Maybe we should just try <br />
To tell ourselves a good lie <br />
Didn't mean to make you cry <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Maybe won't you take it back? <br />
Say you were tryna make me laugh <br />
And nothing has to change today <br />
You didn't mean to say "I love you" <br />
I love you and I don't want to, ooh <br />

</p>
<p className="bridge">
The smile that you gave me <br />
Even when you felt like dying <br />

</p>
<p className="outro">
We fall apart as it gets dark <br />
I'm in your arms in Central Park <br />
There's nothing you could do or say <br />
I can't escape the way I love you <br />
I don't want to, but I love you, ooh <br />
Ooh, ooh <br />
Ooh, ooh <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
“i love you”. I don’t know, that song, I feel like I didn’t even, like, I feel like me and Finneas can’t even believe we wrote that song. That song just shot itself out of me and Finneas, I can’t even tell you. That song, like, I love that song.
<br />

<blockquote>
“i love you” is another song that was written prior to being recorded, so the whole second verse of that song is about sitting on the tarmac on a plane. You know when you press the button on the roof of the airplane to summon the flight attendant. I took that and I pitch shifted it into all of the different chords in the second verse so it followed every chord.
