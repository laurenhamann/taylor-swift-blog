<p className="verse-one">
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood <br />
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww) <br />
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long <br />
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I just wanna make you feel okay <br />
But all you do is look the other way <br />
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay <br />
I just kinda wish you were gay <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Is there a reason we're not through? <br />
Is there a 12 step just for you? <br />
Our conversation's all in blue <br />
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey) <br />
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair <br />
Nine times you never made it there <br />
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away <br />
(Yay) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
How am I supposed to make you feel okay <br />
When all you do is walk the other way? <br />
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay <br />
I just kinda wish you were gay <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
To spare my pride <br />
To give your lack of interest an explanation <br />
Don't say I'm not your type <br />
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation <br />
I'm so selfish <br />
But you make me feel helpless, yeah <br />
And I can't stand another day <br />
Stand another day <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I just wanna make you feel okay <br />
But all you do is look the other way, hmm <br />
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay <br />
I just kinda wish you were gay <br />
I just kinda wish you were gay <br />
I just kinda wish you were gay <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
I wrote this song about a guy that really was not interested in me and it made me feel horrible so the song is called ‘wish you were gay’. And that’s so not meant to be offensive in any way. It literally means I wish he was gay so that he didn’t like me for an actual reason.

And guess what he just came out to me like a couple weeks ago. so I wrote the song and made him fuck a dude. I’m fucking proud bro except not really though because I was really into him, like so into him, he’s so hot oh my god.
