<p className="verse-one">
Don't you know I'm no good for you? <br />
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to <br />
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin' <br />
But nothin' ever stops you leavin' <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own <br />
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <br />
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Don't you know too much already? <br />
I'll only hurt you if you let me <br />
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back) <br />
And I'll call you when the party's over <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own <br />
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <br />
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
But nothin' is better sometimes <br />
Once we've both said our goodbyes <br />
Let's just let it go <br />
Let me let you go <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own <br />
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <br />
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
It’s not really, “I’m sad,” you know what I mean? So “When The Party’s Over,” I feel like that’s such a sentence. It’s like, “I’ll call you when the party’s over,” you’re on the phone with someone and you can’t hear them, they can’t hear you, it’s loud, they’re mad at you for some reason. I feel like everybody’s had that struggle with someone – somebody on the phone yelling for some reason, and you’re just like, “You know what? Fucking leave me alone.
<br />

<blockquote>
Conceptually, most of that song came to me on a drive home from the house of a girl I was dating. It’s one of those cases where I had left her house kind of for no reason. I just sort of had said, ‘Yeah, I gotta go home.’ I remember driving home, and there’s this freeway in L.A., the 2. I was driving down the 2 back to my house, and it’s a very kind of quiet freeway. It just turns around a mountain. I remember just having that quiet when I’m coming home, and I’m on my own. “I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.” When you’re the one putting an end to something, and you’re not actually happy about it, you’re not enjoying it, but you feel compelled to for some reason. I feel like there’s kind of a safety in not letting yourself become fully invested in something.
