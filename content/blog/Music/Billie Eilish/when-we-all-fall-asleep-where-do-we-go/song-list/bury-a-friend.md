<p className="intro">

</p>
<p className="chorus">
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me? <br />
What are you wondering? What do you know? <br />
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me? <br />
When we all fall asleep, where do we go? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Come here <br />
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly <br />
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory? <br />
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly <br />
The way I'm drinkin' you down <br />
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh) <br />
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh) <br />
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh) <br />
Bury a friend, I wanna end me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I wanna end me <br />
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me <br />
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me? <br />
What are you wondering? What do you know? <br />
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me? <br />
When we all fall asleep, where do we go? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Listen <br />
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected? <br />
Me to make you my art and make you a star <br />
And get you connected? <br />
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected <br />
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart <br />
'Cause I'm too expensive <br />
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud <br />
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow) <br />
Calling security, keepin' my head held down <br />
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul <br />
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no <br />
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close <br />
And I can't say no, I can't say no <br />
Careful <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh) <br />
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh) <br />
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh) <br />
Bury a friend, I wanna end me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I wanna end me <br />
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me <br />
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me? <br />
What are you wondering? What do you know? <br />
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me? <br />
When we all fall asleep, where do we go? <br />

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
When we made “bury a friend,” the whole album clicked in my head. I immediately knew what it was going to be about, what the visuals were going to be, and everything in terms of how I wanted it to be perceived. It inspired what the album is about. “bury a friend” is literally from the perspective of the monster under my bed. If you put yourself in that mindset, what is this creature doing or feeling? I also confess that I’m this monster, because I’m my own worst enemy. I might be the monster under your bed, too.

<blockquote>
I think the most pivotal creative decision we made when we were working WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? was the tonal structure of everything shifted from where we had been thus far into a kind of a more violent space. It’s all over the percussion in “​bury a friend.” All of the super blown out, distorted vocals. The crazy alarm sound at the end of that song. They’re all sounds that are kind of jarring, kind of unpleasant, a little bit ominous.
