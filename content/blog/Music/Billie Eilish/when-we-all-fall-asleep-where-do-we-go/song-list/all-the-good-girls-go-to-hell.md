<p className="intro">
My Lucifer is lonely <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Standing there, killing time <br />
Can't commit to anything but a crime <br />
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation <br />
Animals, evidence <br />
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence <br />
Once you get inside 'em <br />
Got friends but can't invite them <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Hills burn in California <br />
My turn to ignore ya <br />
Don't say I didn't warn ya <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All the good girls go to Hell <br />
'Cause even God herself has enemies <br />
And once the water starts to rise <br />
And Heaven's out of sight <br />
She'll want the Devil on her team <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
My Lucifer is lonely <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Look at you needing me <br />
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery <br />
Walk in wearin' fetters <br />
Peter should know better <br />
Your cover up is caving in <br />
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him? <br />
Poisoning themselves now <br />
Begging for our help, wow <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Hills burn in California <br />
My turn to ignore ya <br />
Don't say I didn't warn ya <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All the good girls go to Hell (All the good girls go to Hell) <br />
'Cause even God herself (God herself) has enemies <br />
And once the water starts to rise (Water starts to rise) <br />
And Heaven's out of sight <br />
She'll want the Devil on her team <br />
</p>
<p className="post-bridge">
My Lucifer is lonely <br />
There's nothing left to save now <br />
My god is gonna owe me <br />
There's nothing left to save now <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Haha! <br />
I cannot do the snowflake <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
This song is from the perspective of the devil. Basically, no matter how good you are, amazing you are, incredible you are, desperate measures will turn you bad eventually, at one point in your life.

I think Billie has some of the most engaged listeners I’ve ever met or heard of. I was doing an interview the other day, and the woman I was being interviewed by was like, “I love all the conspiracies about your music. I read somewhere that some fans think "all the good girls go to hell” is about climate change. I love that they think that.“ I was like, "That’s ‘cause it is.” You can think whatever you want about our music. I love that it’s ambiguous. But that’s not a conspiracy theory. That’s just true.
<br />
If there were a God and a Devil, if you believe that there are, the idea that humans have made such a mess of the planet that they’re both talking to each other like, “What’s going on? Why did they do all of this?” That was an appealing concept. “Big hills burn in California.” We grew up here, and one thing about California as a state is that we don’t really have extreme weather in general. There are hurricanes and floods and shit, and we sometimes have earthquakes, but a lot of the time, the natural disasters are not in our backyard. In the last two years, there have been these horrendous wildfires. You could just look out the window and see the skyline on fire. I had this feeling of, Oh, we kinda did this.” Especially because, I think, one or both of those fires were man-made, which is so scary.
