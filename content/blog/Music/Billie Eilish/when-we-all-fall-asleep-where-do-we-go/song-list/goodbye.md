<p className="intro">
Please, please <br />
Don't leave me <br />
Be <br />
</p>
<p className="verse">
It's not true <br />
Take me to the rooftop <br />
Told you not to worry <br />
What do you want from me? <br />
Don't ask questions <br />
Wait a minute <br />
Don't you know I'm no good for you? <br />
Baby, I don't feel so good <br />
And all the good girls go to Hell <br />
Bite my tongue, bide my time <br />
What is it about them? <br />
I'm the bad guy <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
I don’t like when albums just end. I don’t like when a song just ends an album and then nothing feels like it’s actually over. I really wanted something to feel like a finish line, to feel like a period at the end, you know? So the idea was to have that ‘please, don’t leave me be’ right at the beginning, and then basically the rest of the song is every single song on the album, starting from the bottom to the top. And then when it gets to the top, it just kind of dies down and it feels like it’s a goodbye. It almost feels like an RIP.
