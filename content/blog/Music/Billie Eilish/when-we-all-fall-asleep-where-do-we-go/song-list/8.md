<p className="verse-one">
Wait a minute, let me finish <br />
I know you don't care <br />
But can you listen? <br />
I came committed, guess I overdid it <br />
Wore my heart out on a chain <br />
Around my neck, but now it's missin', hmm <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm) <br />
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm) <br />
Oh, hmm, hmm <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So I think I better go <br />
I never really know how to please you <br />
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through <br />
I guess I'm gonna go <br />
I just never know how you feel <br />
Do you even feel anything? <br />
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da <br />
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da <br />
Oh, hmm, hmm <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You said, "Don't treat me badly" <br />
But you said it so sadly <br />
So I did the best I could <br />
Not thinkin' you would have left me gladly <br />
I know you're not sorry <br />
Why should you be? <br />
'Cause who am I to be in love <br />
When your love never is for me? <br />
Me
</p>
<p className="refrain">
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm) <br />
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm) <br />
Oh, hmm, hmm <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So I think I better go <br />
I never really know how to please you <br />
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through <br />
I guess I'm gonna go <br />
I just never know how you feel <br />
Do you even feel anything? <br />

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
I wrote ‘8’ from the perspective of somebody that I hurt….I feel like when people hear that song they’re like, “Oh, poor, baby, Billie, she’s so hurt” I was just a ******** for a minute. I really was. The only way I could deal with it was to just stop for a second and put myself in that person’s place. It’s me empathizing and the thing is that every lyric in that song is towards me.
