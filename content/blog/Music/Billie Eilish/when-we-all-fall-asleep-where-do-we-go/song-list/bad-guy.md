<p className="verse-one">
White shirt now red, my bloody nose <br />
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes <br />
Creepin' around like no one knows <br />
Think you're so criminal <br />
Bruises on both my knees for you <br />
Don't say thank you or please <br />
I do what I want when I'm wanting to <br />
My soul? So cynical <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So you're a tough guy <br />
Like it really rough guy <br />
Just can't get enough guy <br />
Chest always so puffed guy <br />
I'm that bad type <br />
Make your mama sad type <br />
Make your girlfriend mad tight <br />
Might seduce your dad type <br />
I'm the bad guy <br />
Duh <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I'm the bad guy <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I like it when you take control <br />
Even if you know that you don't <br />
Own me, I'll let you play the role <br />
I'll be your animal <br />
My mommy likes to sing along with me <br />
But she won't sing this song <br />
If she reads all the lyrics <br />
She'll pity the men I know <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
So you're a tough guy <br />
Like it really rough guy <br />
Just can't get enough guy <br />
Chest always so puffed guy <br />
I'm that bad type <br />
Make your mama sad type <br />
Make your girlfriend mad tight <br />
Might seduce your dad type <br />
I'm the bad guy <br />
Duh <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I'm the bad guy, duh <br />
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I like when you get mad <br />
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone <br />
You said she's scared of me? <br />
I mean, I don't see what she sees <br />
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I'm a bad guy <br />
I'm, I'm a bad guy <br />
Bad guy, bad guy <br />
I'm a bad <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
It’s basically making fun of everyone and their personas of themselves. Even mine. The initial idea for the song is, like, people who have to tell everybody that they are a certain way all the time? They’re not that certain way. […] In general, I feel like you will never catch a bad bitch telling everyone she’s a bad bitch. It’s on—it’s you. If you’re going around all the time saying, like, ‘Yeah, I’m bad, I’m always breaking rules and doing this and doing that.’ You’re not. I know that because I used to say that and I wasn’t. Bad kids, bad boys, bad bitches, whatever, they do that shit and they don’t even know.

<blockquote>
The sort of greatest challenge of that song was not overthinking it. I did overthink it and then just had to remove everything I overthought about it. I thought I was blowing it by having an instrumental post-chorus, like that [imitates music of “Bad Guy”]. Billie had written all of the lyrics for the outro of the song, and I loved it immediately. She was recording it all in her bedroom. She had her two Yamaha HS5s and an HS8S sub on shelves and they were just rattling the entire room, so they sounded really insane. One of the issues with overload protection is when you bounce something that way, it loses a lot of its fuzz. And so then when I got the files, they didn’t have that emotion to them, that just angry quality. And so then I put headphones on and just abused the sounds until they sounded really aggressive. And the breakthrough was understanding eventually that the two different parts of the songs could be smashed together and they would make it way cooler.
