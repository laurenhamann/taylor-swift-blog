<p className="verse-one">
What is it about them? <br />
I must be missing something <br />
They just keep doing nothing <br />
Too intoxicated to be scared <br />
Better off without them <br />
They're nothing but unstable <br />
Bring ashtrays to the table <br />
And that's about the only thing they share <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm in their secondhand smoke <br />
Still just drinking canned Coke <br />
I don't need a Xanny to feel better <br />
On designated drives home <br />
Only one who's not stoned <br />
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever <br />
</p>
<p className="interlude">
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god <br />
(And it's like, wait, like, when?) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh) <br />
They're late to every party (Ooh) <br />
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh) <br />
Too inebriated now to dance <br />
Morning as they come down (Come down) <br />
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting) <br />
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning) <br />
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm in their secondhand smoke <br />
Still just drinking canned Coke <br />
I don't need a Xanny to feel better <br />
On designated drives home <br />
Only one who's not stoned <br />
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk <br />
On your cigarette break <br />
I can't afford to love someone <br />
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
What is it about them? <br />
I must be missing something <br />
They just keep doin' nothing <br />
Too intoxicated to be scared <br />
Hmm, hmm <br />
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm <br />
Come down <br />
Hurting <br />
Learning <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
I have never done drugs, I’ve never smoked anything in my life, I know people around you doing that shit makes you want to, but you don’t have to, the song’s message is less ‘don’t do drugs’; it’s more ‘be safe'. I don’t want my friends to die any more.
<br />
<b>- Billie Eilish</b>
