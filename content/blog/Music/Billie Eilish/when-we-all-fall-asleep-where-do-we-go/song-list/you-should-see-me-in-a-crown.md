<p className="verse-one">
Bite my tongue, bide my time <br />
Wearing a warning sign <br />
Wait 'til the world is mine <br />
Visions I vandalize <br />
Cold in my kingdom size <br />
Fell for these ocean eyes <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You should see me in a crown <br />
I'm gonna run this nothing town <br />
Watch me make 'em bow <br />
One by one by one <br />
One by one by <br />
You should see me in a crown <br />
Your silence is my favorite sound <br />
Watch me make 'em bow <br />
One by one by one <br />
One by one by one <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Count my cards, watch them fall <br />
Blood on a marble wall <br />
I like the way they all scream <br />
Tell me which one is worse <br />
Living or dying first <br />
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream) <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You say, "Come over, baby <br />
I think you're pretty" <br />
I'm okay, I'm not your baby <br />
If you think I'm pretty <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You should see me in a crown <br />
I'm gonna run this nothing town <br />
Watch me make 'em bow <br />
One by one by one <br />
One by one by <br />
You should see me in a crown <br />
Your silence is my favorite sound <br />
Watch me make 'em bow <br />
One by one by one <br />
One by one by one <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Crown <br />
I'm gonna run this nothing town <br />
Watch me make 'em bow <br />
One by one by one <br />
One by one by <br />
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me) <br />
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me) <br />
Watch me make 'em bow <br />
One by one by one <br />
One by one by one <br />
</p>
