<p className="intro">
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died<br />
There's a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know <br />
Learned my lesson way too long ago <br />
To be talkin' to you, belladonna <br />
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma <br />
Take what I want when I wanna <br />
And I want ya <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Bad, bad news <br />
One of us is gonna lose <br />
I'm the powder, you're the fuse <br />
Just add some friction <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You are my strange addiction <br />
You are my strange addiction <br />
My doctors can't explain <br />
My symptoms or my pain <br />
But you are my strange addiction <br />
</p>
<p className="interlude">
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved <br />
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back <br />
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing <br />
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Deadly fever, please don't ever break <br />
Be my reliever 'cause I don't self medicate <br />
And it burns like a gin and I like it <br />
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it <br />
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Bad, bad news <br />
One of us is gonna lose <br />
I'm the powder, you're the fuse <br />
Just add some friction <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You are my strange addiction <br />
You are my strange addiction <br />
My doctors can't explain <br />
My symptoms or my pain <br />
But you are my strange addiction <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Bite my glass, set myself on fire <br />
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can't you tell I'm wired? <br />
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know <br />
You could kiss my— asking about my motto <br />
</p>
<p className="interlude">
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals <br />
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction <br />
Pretty cool... right? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You are my strange addiction <br />
You are my strange addiction <br />
My doctors can't explain <br />
My symptoms or my pain <br />
But you are my strange addiction <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Did you like it? Did you like that? <br />
Um, which part? <br />
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
I’ve seen The Office 12 times now, counting. Every time I finish it, I start it immediately right after from the beginning again. I have episodes memorized and stuff, it’s my therapy bro, it’s like my little escape. As stupid as that sounds, that show has gotten me through my whole life, I feel like. The song is called ‘my strange addiction’ and its about having somebody be your addiction and like, feeling like your suffocating because you want somebody so bad that it’s like a sickness. And for real it’s just mainly because my strange addiction is The Office.
