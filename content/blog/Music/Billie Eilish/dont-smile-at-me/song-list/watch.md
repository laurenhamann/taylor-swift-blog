<p className="verse-one">
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
</p>
<p className="bridge">
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
</p>
<p className="outro">
Ooh, never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back
Let you back
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
Like, in a relationship, you’re not just in a relationship with that person—you’re in a relationship with that person being in a relationship with you. And you have to have a relationship with yourself to understand how they’re perceiving you… you have to be aware of what you do and what you say. And if you’re self-aware enough—like, this person is treating me really badly, and I feel like nothing, and I feel like waste and not worth anything, then it’s time to leave that relationship! So that’s kind of what the song is about … the old me is so hurt by this and I hate that you’ve made me hurt [like] this. Do you ever feel a certain way about somebody and you hate it? Because you don’t like them, and you don’t like the fact that they make you feel a certain way … like, I don’t want to feel this at all, I did not ask for this, you should not have control over the way I feel, you freaking loser!

<blockquote>
This is me just lighting a bunch of matches in the bathroom. It became the snare essentially for this song of Billie’s called “watch.” The hook is like, “I’ll sit and watch your car burn”, and so there were all these references to starting a fire, and so I was like, “Well let me try starting some matches and whatever” and that’s a more inventive way to use a sound than to just be like, “Yeah, we’re gonna start with the sound of the waves rolling in or something”, you know?
