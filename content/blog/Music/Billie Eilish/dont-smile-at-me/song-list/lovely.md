<p className="verse-one">
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
</p>

<p className="outro">
Woah, yeah
Yeah, ah
Woah, woah
Hello, welcome home
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
[“lovely” is] so cute, but the lyrics don’t mean shit— they do though, here’s the thing though, I feel bad because like, my whole thing is… whatever anything means to me, I try not to like, let it be known, because I like the idea of people’s theories of shit. So like, for instance, like, “bury a friend”, when we put up the song, with like the video and shit, you look at the comments under the video and they’re all like, “This is my theory of what this means”, and then it’s like, a whole thing about, like, what the whole song means to them, and what they think it means to me, and what’s happening, [etc]. And sometimes it’s completely off from what I was thinking, it’s completely true, it’s whatever. And that’s my favorite part, because no one’s wrong, and no one’s really right. Every single answer, and every single theory, and every single, like, interpretation of the song— that’s the point of art, is to have different people feel a certain way. So, I’m not gonna say “lovely” has no meaning, because it definitely does, but it doesn’t though. [Laughs].

none of the hype matters to me ever

i was drawn to khalid the first time i heard him.

at the time there was basically no hype around either of our names honestly but because we both respected the art itself we both created then

that didnt matter

because we respected more

than what was on the outside

that feeling hasnt changed
