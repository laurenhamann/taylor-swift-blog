<p className="intro">
Mind
Mind
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Mind)
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
Bellyache, bellyache)
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>

[“Bellyache” is] flat-out a song about murder. We have a bunch of songs like that: crazy stories about these fictional [situations]. We like to write about stuff we’re going through and things that people relate to, but it’s also really fun to put on a character and act a certain way. That character [in the song] isn’t me—but it also is. The song is really about doing terrible things and not really knowing [why]. We have this whole idea about it—like, you’re doing these terrible things and then you’re like, “Wait, what am I doing? Why did I just do that? Where is my mind? Maybe it’s in the gutter!”

It’s obviously fictional. When me and my brother are writing we find it fun to put yourself into character or become someone else, to write about something we’ve never done before. ‘Bellyache’ is about the concept of guilt, when you do things in the moment because you feel so strongly about them. In the end you’re left with the decision you made. That line—"I thought that I’d feel better, but now I gotta bellyache"—is about how you kinda know that you’re the worst but you don’t care. It’s about a psychopath who regrets being a psychopath but doesn’t really care.
