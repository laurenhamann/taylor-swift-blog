<p className="verse-one">
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
Everybody has a little bit of people copying what they do. And everybody copies what other people do, because before you really know yourself, you’re trying out different personalities. Sometimes people really don’t know themselves because they try out everybody, and they just don’t have any of themselves in them. And they’re kind of everyone else combined. Which is just wack. Just be you, dude. I don’t want to see you as someone else. That’s already them.

It came from a lot of different people. It wasn’t just one specific person. Basically people just do a lot of this same shit I do, and I’m just like, “Can you not?” I already exist.

I write with my brother mostly. That song, we were just in his room, and I was like, “Yo! There’s this fucking girl and she keeps doing everything that I do. And I want to write about it.” Because it was in my mind. A lot. The thing is, I feel like it made it happen so much that you just kind of have to be like, “Ok I get it. You want to do everything I do? You think I’m fly—whatever.” But it’s flattering, mostly, because it’s like, “Oh you know, you like what I do.” But then it gets to a point where you’re not even you anymore.
