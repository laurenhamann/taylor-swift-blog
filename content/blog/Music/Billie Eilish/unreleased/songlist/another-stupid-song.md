<p className="intro">
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-one">
You're saying that you miss me, oh well <br />
I never even got a kiss without a countdown <br />
It's time to face the facts, you treat me like a snack <br />
Only text back when you're hungry <br />
Your love's so insecure, you're never really sure <br />
Boy, you never listen <br />

</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, babe <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
You're saying that you're sorry, so what? <br />
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up <br />
Time to come to terms, put myself first <br />
When your bubble bursts got soap in your eye <br />
I'm telling you it's wrong to break into my songs <br />
Boy, you gotta listen <br />
</p>

<p className="chorus">
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, babe <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
So take this as my last goodbye and play it when you're lonely <br />
Don't you say I didn't try to reach your hand to hold me <br />
I just wanna walk the line, press record then hit rewind <br />
I've made up my mind to erase you, ooh-ooh <br />
To erase you, ooh-ooh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, babe <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
So take this as my last goodbye and play it when you're lonely <br />
Don't you say I didn't try to reach your hand to hold me <br />
I just wanna walk the line, press record then hit rewind <br />
I've made up my mind to erase you, ooh-ooh <br />
To erase you, ooh-ooh <br />
To erase you, ooh-ooh <br />
To erase you, ooh-ooh <br />
</p>
