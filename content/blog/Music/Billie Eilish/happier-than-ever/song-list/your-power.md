<p className="chorus">
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

</p>
<p className="verse-one">
She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes (In your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain
</p>
<p className="outro">
Mmm
Ooh
La-la-la-la-la, hmm
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
“Your Power” song and video out now. this is one of my favorite songs i’ve ever written. i feel very vulnerable putting this one out because i hold it so close to my heart. this is about many different situations that we’ve all either witnessed or experienced. i hope this can inspire change. try not to abuse your power.

It’s really a big subject. It’s about a lot of different things. It’s sadly very relatable for people. I’m not gonna make it about my experiences because it’s really hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands and millions of people have experienced this every single day. It’s everywhere you look and I hate it and I wanted to say something and I’m not gonna get too deep into the specific lyrics and what they mean and what they’re really about but it’s a problem that’s occurring everywhere you look. And everyone is someone or knows someone who’s been taken advantage of.
