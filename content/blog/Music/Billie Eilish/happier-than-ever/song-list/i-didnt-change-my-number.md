<p className="intro">
Okay
Mm-mm, I
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a "You mad at me?" text
Shoulda guessed
That you would think I was upset (Haha)
You're obsessed
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes (Eyes, eyes)
But looks can be deceivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't deserve to feel so hurt
You got a lot of fuckin' nerve
I don't deserve, so
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
And take it out on you
And your best friend, too
I should have left when Drew
Said you were bad news
</p>
<p className="outro">
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
I Didn’t Change My Number… I love this song so much. It’s all about ‘you can’t get me anymore’ where it’s like you know what? I don’t have sympathy for you anymore y'know? You got me! You got me at first but I don’t care now. And it’s really that and that only. And kinda just your last straw and being like ‘I am confident in this being my last straw.’ Y'know don’t get me mad cause I will scream.

<b>- Billie Eilish</b>
