<p className="verse-one">
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I (I), I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I know supposedly I'm lonely now (Lonely now)
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone (Someone)
But aren't I someone? (Aren't I someone? Yeah)
I'd (I'd) like to be your answer (Be your answer)
'Cause you're so handsome (You're so handsome)
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But I (I), I'm in love (Love, love, love, love)
With my future
And you don't know her (Ooh)
And I, I'm in love (Love, love)
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
I spent years and years relying on having someone—I could never be alone. It’s not something you’d think about being hard. But when you’re in that alone zone, it’s a new feeling. I feel like people—everything is about love. There’s nothing that talks about how being alone is really powerful.

we wrote this at the very beginning of quarantine. it’s a song that’s really really personal and special to me. when we wrote this song, it was exactly where my head was at – hopeful, excited and a craaaazy amount of self reflection and self growth. but recently it has also taken on a lot of new meaning in the context of what’s happening in the world now. i hope you can all find meaning in it for yourselves

This was such a satisfying process. It was so, so satisfying. We wrote the song in like two days. Crazy fast for us. This is the most we’ve ever worked in one period of time. But we record, we wrote it like a month into quarantine probably. And it was pouring rain. We were in this like… Oh, it was such a perfect setting. And then we recorded the vocal in Finneas' studio, which is just in his basement in his house…. For me, I’m sure you know, I take fucking forever to get a vocal take that I like, and I do like a billion takes. And this one… I just, I don’t know, there was something about this one take that I did, and I was like, ‘This is the only way that it can be.’ You know what was funny? It was, we were kind of stuck for like a day. We were like, ‘What the fuck do we do here? What do we… where does this go?’ I was like, ‘I don’t think we’re going to get anything done.’ We had the song recorded, but we didn’t have, we didn’t know what to do with it. And we popped in the pool. We got out of the pool, and I was literally going to go home. And I was like, ‘Let’s just fuck around with it a little more.’ And we finished the song that night, like finished completely. It was crazy.
