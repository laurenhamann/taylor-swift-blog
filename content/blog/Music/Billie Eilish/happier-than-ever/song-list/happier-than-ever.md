<p className="chorus">
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
</p>
<p className="outro">
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
“Happier Than Ever,” probably the most therapeutic song I’ve ever written or recorded, like ever, ever, ever ‘cause I just screamed my lungs out and could barely talk afterwards, which was very satisfying to me somehow. I had wanted to get those screams out for a very long time and it was very nice to.

The whole song is more, like, nothing even specific that they did, you’re just not happy being with them. Can’t even explain it. Like say, like you can’t, I can’t explain it.
<b>- Billie Eilish</b>
