<p className="intro">
"He hath come to the bosom of his beloved
Smiling on him, she beareth him to highest heav'n
With yearning heart"
"On thee we gaze, O' gold-wing'd messenger of mighty Gods"
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Gold-winged angel
Go home, don't tell
Anyone what you are
You're sacred and they're starved
And their art is gettin' dark
And there you are to tear apart
Tear apart, tear apart, tear apart
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
They're gonna tell you what you wanna hear
Then they're gonna disappear
Gonna claim you like a souvenir
Just to sell you in a year
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down (Down)
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
</p>
<p className="outro">
That's good
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
“GOLDWING,” I wrote a song that is kinda a metaphor for a young woman especially in the street or life that is pure, and I don’t mean a virgin. I mean like a young, non-exploited, non-traumatized person. A metaphor for that being a gold-winged angel.
<b>- Billie Eilish</b>
