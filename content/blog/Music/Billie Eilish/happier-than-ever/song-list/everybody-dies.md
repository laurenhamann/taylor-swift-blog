<p className="verse-one">
Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
"Everybody dies," that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at least not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' life more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies
And when will I?
</p>
<p className="verse-four">
You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone
You are not unknown
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
This song is a big bummer. It’s really about how everybody dies. You can’t change it and it’s a horrible thought. But it’s also a comforting thought, I don’t know. It gives me comfort to know I’m gonna die. I don’t know why. I’ve talked about it since I was a kid. It makes me happy that all things end. It’s also very sad and sentimental. This song is really just about knowing that you only have so long to do what you want so just do it. Enjoy your life.
<b>- Billie Eilish</b>
