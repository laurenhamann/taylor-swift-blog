<p className="verse-one">
I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3 AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
</p>
<p className="verse-four">
I've been loved before, but right now, in this moment
I feel more and more like I was made for you
For you
</p>
<p className="outro">
I'm sitting in my brother's room
Haven't slept in a week or two, or two
I think I might have fallen in love
What am I to do?
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
“Halley’s Comet,” you know, “Halley’s Comet” is just about falling in love and feeling a feeling of euphoria and life kinda feeling like you’re floating. Love is a crazy, crazy thing and “Halley’s Comet” is just a sweet, little, romantic song.
