<p className="chorus">
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta)
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm not your friend (I'm not your friend)
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man (They wanna, they can try)
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend (I'm not your friend)
Or anything, damn (They wanna)
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
It [“Therefore I Am”] feels like me. The rest of them also feel like me but this one is more like—if I think about it from an outside perspective, this one, I’d be satisfied, you know, if I was a fan. This song is very, very up for interpretation. I’m curious to see what people get from it and also what they feel when they hear it. Yeah, it’s a little mean, a little bit. It [the song] was very fun to complete. It was fun to record, especially, because, I feel like you can hear it. I feel that I sound very, like, I’m just fucking around. I’m just joking and shit. You know that, “Stop, what the hell are you talking about?” It’s like, come on. It’s so real and natural and don’t take me seriously, you know? I love it.

The video is just the way the song feels to me of just kinda like careless and not really trying. The video, number one, we shot on an iPhone which we didn’t even mean to do. It’s basically me running through the empty Glendale Galleria, eating a donut and a pretzel. That’s literally it. It’s some random, chaotic, don’t care shit. And it was so fun, we shot it overnight, shot it on an iPhone, we had barely any crew. It was crazy.
