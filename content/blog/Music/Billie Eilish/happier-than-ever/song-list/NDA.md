<p className="verse-one">
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? (No)
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen (Ha)
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' shit to say, oh-oh-oh
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year (Another year)
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here (I think I hate it here)
Maybe I should think about a new career (Uh)
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth (Shut his mouth, yeah)
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't give me up
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh
</p>
<p className="outro">
Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>

I really wanted it to be unexpected almost. Honestly, it’s so funny because I write with structure in my about verses and pre-choruses and choruses and then verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, chorus, end. And that’s kind of how I learned to write music and same with my brother. This song really, I don’t even know what is what and that is cool to me. You know that, whatever you’d call it, chorus, “You couldn’t save me, but you can’t let me go.” That’s my favorite thing ever. I love that part and I feel like I’ve never done that before.

“NDA” is kinda all over the map. It’s got a lotta different things going on that were completely different situations. It was really just things I was thinking and feeling and doing in my life and I was like, I’ll just write about it. I don’t know, I think it’s very cool. “NDA” is very all over the place and up for interpretation.

“NDA” is a dark gray, just very dark gray, kinda metallic-y. It smells kinda like gas. It just feels like cars to me. That’s why I made the video what it is. It’s kind of gasoline, burning rubber almost smell.
