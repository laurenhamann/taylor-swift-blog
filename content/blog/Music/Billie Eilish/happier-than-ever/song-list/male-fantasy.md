<p className="verse-one">
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
</p>
<p className="interlude">
(You want me to put it here?)
(Okay)
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparable years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
</p>
<p className="outro">
Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should, but I could never hate you
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
“Male Fantasy” is really a hopeless realization and a horrible thing. It’s terrible to feel something that you don’t want to feel. “Happier Than Ever” was actually gonna close the album and then we wrote “Male Fantasy” and it actually felt better to close it with that. Not ending on a angry note, I think, was important ‘cause nothing should end on a bad note, I feel like.

The other day I was talking about how stupid and unrealistic porn is so much of the time. How unrealistic, misogynistic and totally ridiculous the world of porn is. I decided that it was actually a really good idea for a song to talk honestly about pornography because it’s an uncomfortable thing to talk about. Pornography can make you feel violated and good at the same time and this conversation turned into the song. It was hard to write because we wanted it to be as revealing as possible. It’s difficult to be vulnerable and honest and open about my life right now. I find it much easier to write about my past and how I used to feel and to find a new perspective on something that happened to me, to take myself out of a situation. I don’t usually write about what I’m going through in the moment because it’s hard to process it. So this was also about saying how I felt. It was hard and satisfying and revealing and exposing and also incredibly cathartic too.
