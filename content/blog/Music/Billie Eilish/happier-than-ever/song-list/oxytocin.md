<p className="verse-one">
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I love to rub it in like lotion
If you only pray on Sunday, could you come my way on Monday?
'Cause I like to do things God doesn't approve of if She saw us
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
She couldn't look away, look away, look away
She'd wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away

</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
I wanna make you yell (Yell)
I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
Don't wanna treat you well (Well)
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I need you for the oxytocin
If you find it hard to swallow, I can loosen up your collar
'Cause as long as you're still breathing
Don't you even think of leaving
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Not gonna wanna look away, look away, look away
You're gonna wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away
Other people wouldn't stay
Other people don't obey
You and me are both the same
You should really run away
</p>
<p className="outro">
Bad things
To you
I wanna do bad things to you
I wanna make you yell
I wanna do bad things to you
Don't wanna treat you well
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
“Oxytocin” is a fun one. That’s probably one of my favorites. We had all these songs and I was like, the only thing we’re missing is the song that’s purposefully gonna be insane live. And we did “Oxytocin.” Oh, my God, it was the most satisfying thing in the world. We would stand up and jump around and see what felt right. I was also just going through crazy feelings at the time too. You can understand those if you listen to the lyrics.
“Oxytocin” was a “dark brown/red.”
