<p className="verse-one">
I don't really even know how it happened
I started talkin', they started laughin'
I don't really even know how it happened
I started watchin' them photographin'
I don't really (I don't really), how it happened
Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin' (I don't really)
I started walkin' (I don't really), gave no reaction
No reaction
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated

</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I don't really wanna know why it went there (Why it went there)
I kinda don't care (Kinda don't care)
You wanna kill me? (You wanna kill me?)
You wanna hurt me? (Mmm)
Stop bein' flirty
It's kinda workin'
Did you really think "This is the right thing to do"?
(Is it news? News to who?)
That I really look just like the rest of you
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated

</p>
<p className="bridge">
And everybody said it was a letdown
I was only built like everybody else now
But I didn't get a surgery to help out
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?
(Am I?) Am I?
All these other inanimate bitches, it's none of my business
But don't you get sick of posin' for pictures
With that plastic body?
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Man, I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
</p>

## Quotes from the Artist

<blockquote>
We took the production from “Not My Responsibility” and turned it into a beat and then wrote “OverHeated” and it’s really just about the same thing. Why the fuck is it such a shock that I look like all of you? I think that’s the funny thing. The internet, you know, you feel so powerful and somehow invisible at the same time but everybody sees it. You say crazy stuff on the internet thinking “Ah, nobody will see it.” It’s really just about the insanity of paparazzi and articles, and comment sections, and Twitter!

“OverHeated” was “dark/gold/brown/red.”
<b>- Billie Eilish</b>
