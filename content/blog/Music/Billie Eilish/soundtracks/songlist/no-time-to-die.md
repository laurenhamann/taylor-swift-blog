<p className="">
I should have known <br />
I'd leave alone <br />
Just goes to show <br />
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe <br />
We were a pair <br />
But I saw you there <br />
Too much to bear <br />
You were my life, but life is far away from fair <br />
Was I stupid to love you? <br />
Was I reckless to help? <br />
Was it obvious to everybody else? <br />
</p>
<p className="">
That I'd fallen for a lie <br />
You were never on my side <br />
Fool me once, fool me twice <br />
Are you death or paradise? <br />
Now you'll never see me cry <br />
There's just no time to die <br />
</p>
<p className="">
I let it burn <br />
You're no longer my concern, mmm <br />
Faces from my past return <br />
Another lesson yet to learn <br />
</p>
<p className="">
That I'd fallen for a lie <br />
You were never on my side <br />
Fool me once, fool me twice <br />
Are you death or paradise? <br />
Now you'll never see me cry <br />
There's just no time to die <br />
</p>
<p className="">
No time to die, mmm <br />
No time to die, ooh <br />
</p>

<p className="">
Fool me once, fool me twice <br />
Are you death or paradise? <br />
Now you'll never see me cry <br />
There's just no time to die <br />
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
It feels crazy to be a part of this in every way. To be able to score the theme song to a film that is part of such a legendary series is a huge honor. James Bond is the coolest film franchise ever to exist. I’m still in shock.

<blockquote>
Writing the theme song for a Bond film is something we’ve been dreaming about doing our entire lives. There is no more iconic pairing of music and cinema than the likes of Goldfinger and Live and Let Die. We feel so so lucky to play a small role in such a legendary franchise, long live 007.
