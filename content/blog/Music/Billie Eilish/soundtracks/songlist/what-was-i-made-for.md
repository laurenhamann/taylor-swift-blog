<p className="verse-one">
I used to float, now I just fall down <br />
I used to know, but I'm not sure now <br />
What I was made for <br />
What was I made for? <br />
<p>
<p className="verse-two">
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal <br />
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real <br />
Just somethin' you paid for <br />
What was I made for? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I, I <br />
I don't know how to feel <br />
But I wanna try <br />
I don't know how to feel <br />
But someday, I might <br />
Someday, I might <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Mm, mm, ah <br />
Mm, mm, mm <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
When did it end? All the enjoyment <br />
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend <br />
It's not what he's made for <br />
What was I made for? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I, 'cause I <br />
I don't know how to feel <br />
But I wanna try <br />
I don't know how to feel <br />
But someday, I might <br />
Someday, I might <br />
</p>

<p className="outro">
Think I forgot how to be happy <br />
Somethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be <br />
Somethin' I wait for <br />
Somethin' I'm made for <br />
Somethin' I'm made for <br />
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
FINNEAS was like, “Should we try to write a Barbie song?” and I literally was like, “Dog, No. What? We’re not gonna make a- come on,” I thought about like “No Time To Die” That was months of thinking and talking and coming up with different melodies and stuff, and that was also one of my favorite processes of all time but very different, and I was like, “We can’t recreate that, like how are we gonna do that?” and we truly sat down, and Finneas started playing piano and those first couple lyrics “I used to float, now I just fall down” just came right out.
