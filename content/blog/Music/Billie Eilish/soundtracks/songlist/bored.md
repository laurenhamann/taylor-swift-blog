<p className="">
Ah, ah <br />
</p>
<p className="">
The games you played were never fun <br />
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run, ah <br />
</p>
<p className="">
Giving you what you're begging for <br />
Giving you what you say I need <br />
I don't want any settled scores <br />
I just want you to set me free <br />
Giving you what you're begging for <br />
Giving you what you say I need, say I need <br />
</p>
<p className="">
I'm not afraid anymore <br />
What makes you sure you're all I need? (I need) <br />
Forget about it <br />
When you walk out the door and leave me torn <br />
You're teaching me to live without it <br />
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored <br />
</p>
<p className="">
I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where <br />
I hope you don't think that shit's fair, ah <br />
</p>

<p className="">
Giving you all you want and more <br />
Giving you every piece of me <br />
I don't want love I can't afford <br />
I just want you to love for free <br />
Can't you see that I'm getting bored? <br />
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me <br />

</p>
<p className="">
I'm not afraid anymore <br />
What makes you sure you're all I need? <br />
Forget about it <br />
When you walk out the door and leave me torn <br />
You're teaching me to live without it <br />
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored <br />
</p>
<p className="">
Giving you what you're begging for <br />
Giving you what you say I need <br />
I don't want any settled scores <br />
I just want you to set me free <br />
Giving you what you're begging for <br />
Giving you what you say I need, say I need <br />
</p>
<p className="">
I'm not afraid anymore <br />
What makes you sure you're all I need? <br />
Forget about it <br />
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn <br />
You're teaching me to live without it <br />
</p>

## Quotes from Artists

<blockquote>
The video was inspired by being trapped in a relationship that was going nowhere… when you’re in such a toxic place with someone and you’re treated so badly for such a long time that eventually you’re used to it. 
<b> - Billie Eilish </b>
