<p className="chorus">
When I was older <br />
I was a sailor on an open sea <br />
But now I'm underwater <br />
And my skin is paler than it should ever be <br />
Hmm <br />
</p>
<p className="verse">
I'm on my back again <br />
Dreaming of a time and place <br />
Where you and I remain the best of friends <br />
Even after all this ends <br />
Can we pretend? <br />
I'm on my, I'm on my back again <br />
It's seeming more and more <br />
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends <br />
Before it breaks in half and then <br />
We bend it back again <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Guess I got caught in the middle of it <br />
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it <br />
In my blood, in my blood <br />
Memories burn like a forest fire <br />
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud <br />
In the flood <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When I was older <br />
I was a sailor on an open sea <br />
But now I'm underwater <br />
And my skin is paler than it should ever be <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I'm watching movies back to back in black and white, I never <br />
Seen anybody do it like I do it any better <br />
Been goin' over you, I'm overdue for new endeavors <br />
Nobody lonely like I'm lonely and I don't know whether <br />
You'd really like it in the limelight <br />
You'd sympathize with all the bad guys <br />
I'm still a victim in my own right <br />
But I'm the villain in my own eyes, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
When I was older <br />
I was a sailor on an open sea <br />
</p>
