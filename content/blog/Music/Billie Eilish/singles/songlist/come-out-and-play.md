<p className="intro">
My winter nights are taken up by static <br />
Stress and holiday shopping traffic <br />
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else <br />
Just like magic <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm <br />
Where the people would come <br />
To dance under sparkling lights <br />
Bundled up in their mittens and coats <br />
And the cider would flow <br />
And I just wanna be there tonight <br />
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon <br />
Mistakes are forgiven <br />
And everythin' is icy and blue <br />
And you would be there too <br />
</p>

<p className="chorus">
Under the mistletoe <br />
Watchin' the fire glow <br />
And tellin' me, "I love you" <br />
Just bein' in your arms <br />
Takes me back to that little farm <br />
Where every wish comes true <br />
</p>

<p className="verse-two">
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm <br />
There's a light in the barn <br />
We run inside out from the cold <br />
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs <br />
And they're warm and they're safe <br />
They wake to see a blanket of snow <br />
</p>

<p className="pre-chorus">
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon <br />
Mistakes are forgiven <br />
And everythin' is icy and blue <br />
And you would be there too <br />
</p>

<p className="chorus">
Under the mistletoe <br />
Watchin' the fire glow <br />
And tellin' me, "I love you" <br />
Just bein' in your arms <br />
Takes me back to that little farm <br />
Where every wish comes true <br />
Baby, yeah <br />
</p>

<p className="bridge">
And when I'm feelin' alone <br />
You remind me of home <br />
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas <br />
And when the world isn't fair <br />
I pretend that we're there <br />
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you) <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Under the mistletoe (To you) <br />
Watching the fire glow <br />
And tellin' me, "I love you" <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas <br />
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling) <br />
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas <br />
I love you <br />
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas <br />
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know) <br />
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas <br />
Where every wish comes true <br />
I love you <br />
</p>

## Quotes from Artist

<blockquote>
I actually did grow up on a Christmas tree farm. In a gingerbread house, deep within the yummy gummy gumdrop forest. Where, funnily enough, this song is their national anthem.
<br />
<b> - Taylor Swift </b>

<blockquote>
So the idea I had for the song is “Christmas Tree Farm,” because I grew up on one, see what I mean? These are chords I don’t usually use, so bear with me, but it would be, like… it’s about how, like, you’re in the city and you’re stressed out and you’re, like, just feeling really, like, low, but in your heart is a Christmas tree farm.
<br />
