<p className="verse-one">
She can't see the way your eyes <br />
Light up when you smile <br />
She'll never notice how you stop and stare <br />
Whenever she walks by <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her <br />
But you are everything to me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I just wanna show you <br />
She don't even know you <br />
She's never gonna love you like I want to <br />
And you just see right through me <br />
But if you only knew me <br />
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable <br />
Instead of just invisible <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
There's a fire inside of you <br />
That can't help but shine through <br />
She's never gonna see the light <br />
No matter what you do <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And all I think about is how to make you think of me <br />
And everything that we could be <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I just wanna show you <br />
She don't even know you <br />
She's never gonna love you like I want to <br />
And you just see right through me <br />
But if you only knew me <br />
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable <br />
Instead of just invisible <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Like shadows in a faded light <br />
Oh, we're invisible <br />
I just wanna open your eyes <br />
And make you realize <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I just wanna show you <br />
She don't even know you <br />
Baby, let me love you, let me want you <br />
You just see right through me <br />
But if you only knew me <br />
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable <br />
Instead of just invisible <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh oh, yeah <br />
She can't see the way your eyes <br />
Light up when you smile <br />
</p>
