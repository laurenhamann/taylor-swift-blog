<p className="chorus">
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart <br />
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now <br />
Why would you wanna make the very first scar <br />
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall <br />
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
No matter what you say I still can't believe <br />
That you would walk away <br />
It don't make sense to me but <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart <br />
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now <br />
Why would you wanna make the very first scar <br />
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
It's not unbroken anymore <br />
How do I get it back the way it was before <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart <br />
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now <br />
Why would you wanna make the very first scar <br />
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a <br />
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart <br />
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now <br />
Why would you wanna make the very first scar <br />
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart <br />
</p>
