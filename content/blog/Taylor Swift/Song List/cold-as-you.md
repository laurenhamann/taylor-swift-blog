<p className="verse-one">
You have a way of coming easily to me <br />
And when you take, you take the very best of me <br />
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel somethin' <br />
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, what a shame <br />
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day <br />
Just walk away <br />
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say <br />
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through <br />
I've never been anywhere cold as you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You put up the walls and paint them all a shade of gray <br />
And I stood there loving you, and wished them all away <br />
And you come away with a great little story <br />
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, what a shame <br />
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day <br />
Just walk away <br />
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say <br />
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through <br />
I've never been anywhere cold as you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You never did give a damn thing, honey <br />
But I cried, cried for you <br />
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you <br />
Died for you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, what a shame <br />
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day <br />
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending <br />
Countin' all the scars you've made <br />
Now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through <br />
I've never been anywhere cold as you <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I wrote this song with Liz [Rose], and I think the lyrics to this song are some of the best we’ve ever written. It’s about that moment where you realize someone isn’t at all who you thought they were, and that you’ve been trying to make excuses for someone who doesn’t deserve them. And that some people are just never going to love you. We were halfway through writing this when I started singing ‘And now that I’m sitting here thinking it through, I’ve never been anywhere cold as you.’ - Taylor Swift
