<p className="verse-one">
Friday night beneath the stars <br />
In a field behind your yard <br />
You and I are painting pictures in the sky <br />
And sometimes we don't say a thing <br />
Just listen to the crickets sing <br />
Everything I need is right here by my side <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I know everything about you <br />
I don't wanna live without you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm only up when you're not down <br />
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground <br />
It's like no matter what I do <br />
Well, you drive me crazy half the time <br />
The other half I'm only trying to <br />
Let you know that what I feel is true <br />
And I'm only me when I'm with you <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Just a small town boy and girl <br />
Living in a crazy world <br />
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true <br />
And I don't try to hide my tears <br />
The secrets, or my deepest fears <br />
Through it all nobody gets me like you do <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And you know everything about me <br />
You say that you can't live without me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm only up when you're not down <br />
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground <br />
It's like no matter what I do <br />
Well, you drive me crazy half the time <br />
The other half I'm only trying to <br />
Let you know that what I feel is true <br />
And I'm only me when I'm with you <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
When I'm with anybody else <br />
It's so hard to be myself <br />
Only you can tell <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
That I'm only up when you're not down <br />
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground <br />
It's like no matter what I do <br />
Well, you drive me crazy half the time <br />
The other half I'm only trying to <br />
Let you know that what I feel is true <br />
And I'm only me, who I wanna be <br />
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
With you, oh yeah <br />
