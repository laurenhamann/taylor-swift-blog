<p className="verse-one">
Corey's eyes are like a jungle <br />
He smiles, it's like the radio <br />
He whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows <br />
These pretty girls on every corner <br />
They watch him as he's walking home, saying, "Does he know?" <br />
Will you ever know? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You're beautiful <br />
Every little piece, love <br />
And don't you know <br />
You're really gonna be someone <br />
Ask anyone <br />
And when you find everything you looked for <br />
I hope your life will lead you back to my door <br />
Oh, but if it don't <br />
Stay beautiful <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Corey finds another way to be the highlight of my day <br />
I'm taking pictures in my mind so I can save them for a rainy day <br />
It's hard to make a conversation when he's taking my breath away <br />
I should say <br />
Hey, by the way <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You're beautiful <br />
Every little piece, love <br />
And don't you know <br />
You're really gonna be someone <br />
Ask anyone <br />
And when you find everything you looked for <br />
I hope your life will lead you back to my door <br />
Oh, but if it don't <br />
Stay beautiful <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
If you and I are a story <br />
That never gets told <br />
If what you are is a daydream <br />
I'll never get to hold <br />
At least you'll know <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You're beautiful <br />
Every little piece, love <br />
And don't you know <br />
You're really gonna be someone <br />
Ask anyone <br />
And when you find everything you looked for <br />
I hope your life will lead you back to my front door <br />
Oh, but if it don't <br />
Will you stay <br />
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful? <br />
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful? <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
La la la la <br />
Oh-oh-oh, oh <br />
Oh, but if it don't <br />
Stay beautiful <br />
Stay beautiful <br />
Na, na, na, na, na <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>

After hearing my songs, a lot of people ask me, `How many boyfriends have you had?‘ And I always tell them that more of my songs come from observation than actual experience. In other words, you don’t have to date someone to write a song about them. This is a song I wrote about a guy I never dated! Wow, right? [Laughs] This song is about a guy I thought was cute, and never really talked to him much. But something about him inspired this song, just watching him. - Taylor Swift
