<p className="verse-one">
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy <br />
I realise you love yourself more than you could ever love me <br />
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy <br />
That's fine, you won't mind if I say <br />
And by the way <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I hate that stupid old pickup truck <br />
You never let me drive <br />
You're a redneck heartbreaker <br />
Who's really bad at lying <br />
So watch me strike a match <br />
On all my wasted time <br />
As far as I'm concerned you're <br />
Just another picture to burn <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
There's no time for tears <br />
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge <br />
There's nothing stopping me <br />
From going out with all of your best friends <br />
And if you come around saying sorry to me <br />
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck <br />
You never let me drive <br />
You're a redneck heartbreaker <br />
Who's really bad at lying <br />
So watch me strike a match <br />
On all my wasted time <br />
As far as I'm concerned you're <br />
Just another picture to burn <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And if you're missing me <br />
You'd better keep it to yourself <br />
'Cause coming back around here <br />
Would be bad for your health <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck <br />
You never let me drive <br />
You're a redneck heartbreaker <br />
Who's really bad at lying <br />
So watch me strike a match <br />
On all my wasted time <br />
In case you haven't heard <br />
I really, really hate that <br />
Stupid old pickup truck <br />
You never let me drive <br />
You're a redneck heartbreaker <br />
Who's really bad at lying <br />
So watch me strike a match <br />
On all my wasted time <br />
As far as I'm concerned you're <br />
Just another picture to burn <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn <br />
You're just another picture to burn <br />
Baby, burn <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
I had this song called ‘Picture to Burn,’ that’s talking about how ‘I hate your truck,’ and ‘I hate that you ignored me,’ ‘I hate you,’ “ she explained. "Now, the way that I would say that and the way that I would feel that kind of pain is a lot different. - Taylor Swift
