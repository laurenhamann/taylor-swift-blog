<p className="verse-one">
Drew looks at me <br />
I fake a smile so he won't see <br />
What I want and I need <br />
And everything that we should be <br />
I'll bet she's beautiful <br />
That girl he talks about <br />
And she's got everything <br />
That I have to live without <br />
Drew talks to me <br />
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny <br />
But I can't even see <br />
Anyone when he's with me <br />
He says he's so in love <br />
He's finally got it right <br />
I wonder if he knows <br />
He's all I think about at night <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar <br />
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star <br />
He's the song in the car I keep singing <br />
Don't know why I do <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Drew walks by me <br />
Can he tell that I can't breathe? <br />
And there he goes, so perfectly <br />
The kind of flawless I wish I could be <br />
She better hold him tight <br />
Give him all her love <br />
Look in those beautiful eyes <br />
And know she's lucky 'cause <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar <br />
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star <br />
He's the song in the car I keep singing <br />
Don't know why I do <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
So I drive home alone <br />
As I turn out the light <br />
I'll put his picture down <br />
And maybe get some sleep tonight <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar <br />
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart <br />
He's the song in the car I keep singing <br />
Don't know why I do <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
He's the time taken up but there's never enough <br />
And he's all that I need to fall into <br />
Drew looks at me <br />
I fake a smile so he won't see <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
This is a song that I wrote about a guy who went to school with me, and I was that ‘friend,’ you know, that girl who’s your friend. And, you know, he had this awesome girlfriend who he would tell me about every single day. And, you know, I was that girl that he would go to and be like, ‘what should I get her for Valentine’s Day? I have to make this Valentine’s Day so awesome! It’s her birthday, what should I do? What would the perfect gift for a girl be?’ And of course I’d give him, like, the most awesome ideas, awesome plans, like, I would want them! And, you know, it didn’t end up, like, in the end of the chick-flick where they get together in the end. It didn’t happen like that. So I wrote a song and I put it out on the radio, and they’re still together! […] I think right under his driver’s license where it says ‘Drew Hardwick’ it says ‘Taylor wrote a song about me.’ But I haven’t talked to him in a while, I haven’t talked to him for probably a year and a half, but I’ve heard through the grape vine that he’s very well aware of [the song.] But, you know, it’s crazy how having a top five hit with a song won’t get you over somebody. - Taylor Swift
