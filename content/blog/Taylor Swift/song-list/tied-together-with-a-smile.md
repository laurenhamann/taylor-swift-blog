<p className="verse-one">
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty <br />
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you <br />
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty <br />
But that's not true <br />
'Cause I know you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hold on, baby, you're losing it <br />
The water's high, you're jumping into it <br />
And letting go and no one knows <br />
That you cry but you don't tell anyone <br />
That you might not be the golden one <br />
And you're tied together with a smile <br />
But you're coming undone <br />
Oh-oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted <br />
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change <br />
Hoping it will end up in his pocket <br />
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain <br />
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay <br />
It's not his price to pay <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hold on, baby, you're losing it <br />
The water's high, you're jumping into it <br />
And letting go and no one knows <br />
That you cry but you don't tell anyone <br />
That you might not be the golden one <br />
And you're tied together with a smile <br />
But you're coming undone <br />
Oh-oh-oh <br />
Oh-oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Hold on, baby, you're losing it <br />
The water's high, you're jumping into it <br />
And letting go and no one knows <br />
That you cry but you don't tell anyone <br />
That you might not be the golden one <br />
And you're tied together with a smile <br />
But you're coming undone <br />
Oh-oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You're tied together with a smile <br />
But you're coming undone <br />
Oh woah woah <br />
Goodbye, baby <br />
With a smile, baby, baby <br />
Oh-oh <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
There’s one on the album called ‘Tied Together With a Smile’ that I wrote about one of my friends, who is this beauty queen, pageant princess — a gorgeous, popular girl in high school. Every guy wanted to be with her, every girl wanted to be her. I wrote that song the day I found out she had an eating disorder. There are a couple songs on the album like that, that are just watching other people and making observations. - Taylor Swift

<blockquote>
[The song] is about a girl I knew my freshman year. She was absolutely Miss Popular, a pageant girl, and she looked perfect every day! Always had the cutest outfits, always looked the best at prom. But sometimes when you get a little closer to people who look that perfect, you realize that they don’t feel perfect. They feel like they’re ugly. And that’s what happened with this girl — I became closer friends with her, and one day she confessed that she was bulimic. It was really hard for me to take, but I never want to make someone feel horrible. I try to reason with them and be calm about it. After a while, I was just like, ‘you don’t need to do that anymore.’ So I played that song for her, and I said, ‘who do you think that’s about?’ And honestly, I don’t think she ever did it after that. - Taylor Swift
