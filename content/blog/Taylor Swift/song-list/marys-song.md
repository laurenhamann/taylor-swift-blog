<p className="verse-one">
She said <br />
"I was seven, and you were nine <br />
I looked at you like the stars that shined <br />
In the sky, the pretty lights." <br />
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us <br />
Growing up and fallin' in love <br />
And our mamas smiled, and rolled their eyes <br />
And said, "Oh, my, my, my" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree <br />
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me <br />
You never did, you never did <br />
Take me back when our world was one block wide <br />
I dared you to kiss me, and ran when you tried <br />
Just two kids, you and I <br />
Oh, my, my, my, my <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly <br />
I wasn't that little girl you used to see <br />
But your eyes still shined, like pretty lights <br />
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us <br />
They never believed we'd really fall in love <br />
And our mamas smiled, and rolled their eyes <br />
And said, "Oh, my, my, my" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up <br />
Two AM, ridin' in your truck <br />
And all I need is you next to me <br />
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight <br />
Slammin' of doors 'stead of kissin' goodnight <br />
You stayed outside 'til the morning light <br />
Oh, my, my, my, my <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
A few years had gone and come around <br />
We were sittin' at our favorite spot in town <br />
And you looked at me, got down on one knee <br />
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle <br />
Our whole town came, and our mamas cried <br />
You said, "I do, " and I did too <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Take me home where we met so many years before <br />
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch <br />
After all this time, you and I <br />
And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine <br />
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine in the sky <br />
Oh, my, my, my <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
I wrote this song about a couple who lived next door to us. They’d been married forever and they came over one night for dinner and were just so cute. They were talking about how they fell in love and got married, and how they met when they were just little kids. I thought it was so sweet because you can go to the grocery store and read the tabloids, and see who’s breaking up and cheating on each other, or just listen to some of my songs, haha. But it was really comforting to know that all I had to do was go home and look next door to see a perfect example of forever. - Taylor Swift
