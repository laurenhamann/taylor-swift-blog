<p className="verse-one">
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me <br />
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out <br />
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking <br />
Trying to see through the rain coming down <br />
Even though I'm not the only one <br />
Who feels the way I do <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know <br />
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on <br />
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans <br />
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve <br />
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine <br />
Could you tell me what more do I need <br />
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah <br />
But that's OK <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know <br />
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on <br />
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission <br />
But I'm ready to fly <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know <br />
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on <br />
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know <br />
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh I'm just a girl
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
I wrote this song when I was thirteen and had just moved to Nashville. It was tough trying to find out how I was going to get where I wanted to go. I knew where I wanted to be, but I just didn’t know how to get there. I’m really happy this is on the album, because I feel like I finally figured it out. - Taylor Swift
