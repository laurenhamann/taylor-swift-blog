<p className="verse-one">
He said the way my blue eyes shined <br />
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night <br />
I said, "That's a lie" <br />
Just a boy in a Chevy truck <br />
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck <br />
On back roads at night <br />
And I was right there beside him all summer long <br />
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But when you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think my favorite song <br />
The one we danced to all night long <br />
The moon like a spotlight on the lake <br />
When you think happiness <br />
I hope you think that little black dress <br />
Think of my head on your chest <br />
And my old faded blue jeans <br />
When you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think of me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
September saw a month of tears <br />
And thankin' God that you weren't here <br />
To see me like that <br />
But in a box beneath my bed <br />
Is a letter that you never read <br />
From three summers back <br />
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet <br />
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think my favorite song <br />
The one we danced to all night long <br />
The moon like a spotlight on the lake <br />
When you think happiness <br />
I hope you think that little black dress <br />
Think of my head on your chest <br />
And my old faded blue jeans <br />
When you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think of me <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I'm back for the first time since then <br />
I'm standin' on your street <br />
And there's a letter left on your doorstep <br />
And the first thing that you'll read <br />
Is when you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think my favorite song <br />
Someday you'll turn your radio on <br />
I hope it takes you back to that place <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When you think happiness <br />
I hope you think that little black dress <br />
Think of my head on your chest <br />
And my old faded blue jeans <br />
When you think Tim McGraw <br />
I hope you think of me <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh, think of me, hmm <br />
He said the way my blue eyes shined <br />
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night <br />
I said, "That's a lie" <br />
</p>



## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
This song means so much to me, that’s why we wanted it to be the first track on the album. The idea for this song came to me in math class. I just started singing to myself `When you think Tim McGraw.‘ The concept for this song hit me, because I was dating a guy who moved away, and it was going to be over for us. So I started thinking of things that I knew would remind him of me. The first thing that came to mind was that my favorite song is by Tim McGraw. After school, I went downtown, sat down at the piano, and wrote this with Liz Rose in fifteen minutes. It may be the best fifteen minutes I’ve ever experienced.

It deals with the haunting power of music and how hearing a song years after it was first popular can have such an emotional appeal. - Taylor Swift
