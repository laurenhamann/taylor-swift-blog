<p className="verse-one">
I don't think that passenger seat <br />
Has ever looked this good to me <br />
He tells me about his night <br />
And I count the colors in his eyes <br />
He'll never fall in love <br />
He swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair <br />
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong <br />
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind <br />
He tells a joke, I fake a smile <br />
But I know all his favorite songs <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I could tell you <br />
His favorite color's green <br />
He loves to argue <br />
Born on the Seventeenth <br />
His sister's beautiful <br />
He has his father's eyes <br />
And if you ask me if I love him.. <br />
I'd lie <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
He looks around the room <br />
Innocently overlooks the truth <br />
Shouldn't a light go on? <br />
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long? <br />
He sees everything in black and white <br />
Never let nobody see him cry <br />
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I could tell you <br />
His favorite color's green <br />
He loves to argue <br />
Born on the Seventeenth <br />
His sister's beautiful <br />
He has his father's eyes <br />
And if you ask me if I love him.. <br />
I'd lie <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
He stands there, then walks away <br />
My God, if I could only say <br />
I'm holding every breath for you <br />
He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar <br />
I think he can see through everything but my heart <br />
First thought when I wake up is <br />
My God, he's beautiful <br />
So I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Yes I could tell you <br />
His favorite color's green <br />
He loves to argue <br />
Oh, and he kills me <br />
His sister's beautiful <br />
He has his father's eyes <br />
And if you ask me if I love him.. <br />
If you ask me if I love him.. <br />
I'd lie <br />
</p>
