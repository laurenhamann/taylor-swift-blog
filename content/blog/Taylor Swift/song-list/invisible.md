<p className="verse-one">
She can't see the way your eyes <br />
Light up when you smile <br />
She'll never notice how you stop and stare <br />
Whenever she walks by <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her <br />
But you are everything to me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I just wanna show you <br />
She don't even know you <br />
She's never gonna love you like I want to <br />
And you just see right through me <br />
But if you only knew me <br />
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable <br />
Instead of just invisible <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
There's a fire inside of you <br />
That can't help but shine through <br />
She's never gonna see the light <br />
No matter what you do <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And all I think about is how to make you think of me <br />
And everything that we could be <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I just wanna show you <br />
She don't even know you <br />
She's never gonna love you like I want to <br />
And you just see right through me <br />
But if you only knew me <br />
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable <br />
Instead of just invisible <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Like shadows in a faded light <br />
Oh, we're invisible <br />
I just wanna open your eyes <br />
And make you realize <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I just wanna show you <br />
She don't even know you <br />
Baby, let me love you, let me want you <br />
You just see right through me <br />
But if you only knew me <br />
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable <br />
Instead of just invisible <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Oh oh, yeah <br />
She can't see the way your eyes <br />
Light up when you smile <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
Then there’s the song “Invisible,” which is about the son of my parents' friends. They were always at my house and their son was my age, and he would always tell me about other girls he liked. I felt, well, invisible. Obviously. So I wrote that song about it, and it was a bonus track on my first album. - Taylor Swift
