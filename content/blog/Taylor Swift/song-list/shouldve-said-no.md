<p className="verse-one">
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing <br />
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone <br />
Yesterday I found out about you <br />
Even now just looking at you feels wrong <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance <br />
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You should've said no, you should've gone home <br />
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go <br />
You should've known that word <br />
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me <br />
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind <br />
I shouldn't be asking myself why <br />
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet <br />
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You can see that I've been crying <br />
Baby, you know all the right things to say <br />
But do you honestly expect me to believe <br />
We could ever be the same <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance <br />
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You should've said no, you should've gone home <br />
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go <br />
You should've known that word <br />
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me <br />
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind <br />
I shouldn't be asking myself why <br />
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet <br />
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me <br />
Oh-oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I can't resist, before you go, tell me this <br />
Was it worth it? <br />
Was she worth this? <br />
No, oh no, no, no, no, no <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You should've said no, you should've gone home <br />
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go <br />
You should've known that word <br />
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me <br />
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind <br />
I shouldn't be asking myself why <br />
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet <br />
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
Just being a human being, I’ve realized that before every big problem you create for yourself, before every huge mess you have to clean up, there was a crucial moment where you could’ve just said no. This is a song I wrote about a guy who never should have cheated on me. - Taylor Swift
