<p className='chorus'>
I wanna be your endgame <br />
I wanna be your first string <br />
I wanna be your A-Team <br />
I wanna be your endgame, endgame <br />
</p>
<p className='post-chorus'>
Big reputation, big reputation <br />
Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ah <br />
And you heard about me, ooh <br />
I got some big enemies <br />
Big reputation, big reputation <br />
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ah <br />
And I heard about you, ooh <br />
You like the bad ones too <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-one'>
You so dope, don't overdose <br />
I'm so stoked, I need a toast <br />
We do the most <br />
I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat <br />
I got a reputation girl, that don't precede me <br />
I'm one call away, whenever you need me <br />
I'm in a G5 <br />
Come to the A side <br />
I got a bad boy persona that's what they like <br />
You love it <br />
I love it too 'cause you my type <br />
You hold me down and I protect you with my life <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be) <br />
Just anther ex-love (you don't wanna see) <br />
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you) <br />
Like the other girls do <br />
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be) <br />
Drinkin' on a beach with (you all over me) <br />
I know what they all say (I know what they all say) <br />
But I ain't tryna play <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
I wanna be your endgame <br />
I wanna be your first string <br />
I wanna be your A Team <br />
I wanna be your endgame, endgame <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-two'>
Knew her when I was young <br />
Reconnected when we were little bit older <br />
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders <br />
Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee deep <br />
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me <br />
Even when we'd argue, we don't do it for long <br />
And you understand the good and bad, end up in the song <br />
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease <br />
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities <br />
I've made mistakes, and made some choices that's hard to deny <br />
After the storm, something was born on the fourth of July <br />
I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one <br />
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be) <br />
Just anther ex-love (you don't wanna see) <br />
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you) <br />
Like the other girls do <br />
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be) <br />
Drinkin' on a beach with (you all over me) <br />
I know what they all say <br />
But I ain't tryna play <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
I wanna be your endgame <br />
I wanna be your first string <br />
I wanna be your A Team <br />
I wanna be your endgame, endgame <br />
</p>
<p className='post-chorus'>
Big reputation, big reputation <br />
Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ahh <br />
And you heard about me, ooh <br />
I got some big enemies <br />
Big reputation, big reputation <br />
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ahh <br />
And I heard about you, ooh <br />
You like the bad ones too <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
I hit you like bang <br />
We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't <br />
<strong className='fav-line'>
And I bury hatchets but I keep maps of where I put 'em <br />
</strong>
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy <br />
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me <br />
And I can't let you go, your hand print's on my soul <br />
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold <br />
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks <br />
So here's the truth from my red lips <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
I wanna be your endgame <br />
I wanna be your first string <br />
I wanna be your A Team <br />
I wanna be your endgame, endgame <br />
I wanna be your endgame <br />
I wanna be your first string <br />
I wanna be your A Team <br />
I wanna be your endgame, endgame <br />
</p>

## Quote from artist
<blockquote>
I actually wrote [my verse] in, I remember where it was, I was in a hotel room in New York, in bed at about eight o'clock in the morning. I woke up ‘cause for some reason I, like, dreamed it in my head what I was gonna do. […] I woke up and then, like, typed it all out and then recorded it like a day later and sent it to [Taylor]. And I remember [she] liked it, which is good, positive. […] I’ve never really featured like this, maybe I’ve done, like, two tracks where I’ve featured. […] Well, you see, [the “Fourth of July” line] is kind of a play on words. Not really a play on words, it’s kind of… there’s a film with Tom Cruise called Born on the Fourth of July… my relationship started on the fourth of July. - Ed Sheeran

<blockquote>
I really, really, really, really, really, really liked [Ed’s verse] because [he hadn’t] done the, like, cadence, rhythmic thing since Plus. […] The “fourth of July” line makes me really happy. […] I also like, um, like, I don’t know, “I’ve got chips on both of my shoulders,” I like that a lot. - Taylor Swift
