<p className='chorus'>
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-one'>
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes <br />
I struck a match and blew your mind <br />
But I didn't mean it, and you didn't see it <br />
The ties were black, the lies were white <br />
In shades of gray in candlelight <br />
I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart <br />
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself <br />
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed <br />
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (oh!) <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
You were drivin' the getaway car <br />
We were flyin', but we'd never get far <br />
Don't pretend it's such a mystery <br />
Think about the place where you first met me <br />
Ridin' in a getaway car <br />
There were sirens in the beat of your heart <br />
Should've known I'd be the first to leave <br />
Think about the place where you first met me <br />
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh <br />
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah <br />
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-two'>
It was the great escape, the prison break <br />
The light of freedom on my face <br />
But you weren't thinkin' and I was just drinkin' <br />
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', "Go, go, go!" <br />
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow <br />
And a circus ain't a love story, and now we're both sorry (we're both sorry) <br />
</p>
<p className='pre-chorus'>
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart <br />
He poisoned the well, every man for himself <br />
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed <br />
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (oh!) <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
You were drivin' the getaway car <br />
We were flyin', but we'd never get far <br />
Don't pretend it's such a mystery <br />
Think about the place where you first met me <br />
Ridin' in a getaway car <br />
There were sirens in the beat of your heart <br />
Should've known I'd be the first to leave <br />
Think about the place where you first met me <br />
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh <br />
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah <br />
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car <br />
</p>
<p className='bridge'>
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (oh-oh) <br />
Until I switched to the other side, to the other side <br />
It's no surprise I turned you in (oh-oh) <br />
'Cause us traitors never win <br />
I'm in a getaway car <br />
I left you in a motel bar <br />
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys <br />
That was the last time you ever saw me (oh!) <br />
</p>
<p className='chorus'>
Drivin' the getaway car <br />
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (don't pretend) <br />
Don't pretend it's such a mystery <br />
Think about the place where you first met me <br />
Ridin' in a getaway car <br />
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (should've known) <br />
Should've known I'd be the first to leave <br />
Think about the place where you first met me <br />
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh <br />
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah <br />
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car <br />
</p>
<p className='outro'>
I was ridin' in a getaway car <br />
I was cryin' in a getaway car <br />
<strong className="fav-line">
I was dyin' in a getaway car <br />
</strong>
Said goodbye in a getaway car <br />
Ridin' in a getaway car <br />
I was cryin' in a getaway car <br />
I was dyin' in a getaway car <br />
Said goodbye in a getaway car <br />
