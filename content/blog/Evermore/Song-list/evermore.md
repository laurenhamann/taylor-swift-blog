<p className="verse-one">
Gray November <br />
I've been down since July <br />
Motion capture <br />
Put me in a bad light <br />
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone <br />
Trying to find the one where I went wrong <br />
Writing letters <br />
Addressed to the fire <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I was catching my breath <br />
Staring out an open window <br />
Catching my death <br />
And I couldn't be sure <br />
I had a feeling so peculiar <br />
That this pain would be for <br />
Evermore <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Hey December <br />
Guess I'm feeling unmoored <br />
Can't remember <br />
What I used to fight for <br />
I rewind the tape but all it does is pause <br />
On the very moment all was lost <br />
Sending signals <br />
To be double crossed <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I was catching my breath <br />
Barefoot in the wildest winter <br />
Catching my death <br />
And I couldn't be sure <br />
I had a feeling so peculiar <br />
That this pain would be for <br />
Evermore <br />
(Evermore) <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Can't not think of all the cost <br />
And the things that will be lost <br />
Oh, can we just get a pause? <br />
To be certain we'll be tall again <br />
Whether weather be the frost <br />
Or the violence of the dog days <br />
I'm on waves, out being tossed <br />
Is there a line that I could just go cross? <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And when I was shipwrecked (can't think of all the cost) <br />
I thought of you (all the things that will be lost now) <br />
In the cracks of light (can we just get a pause?) <br />
I dreamed of you (to be certain we'll be tall again) <br />
(If you think of all the costs) <br />
It was real enough (whether weather be the frost) <br />
To get me through (or the violence of the dog days) <br />
(Out on waves being tossed) <br />
But I swear (is there a line that we could just go cross?) <br />
You were there <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I was catching my breath <br />
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step <br />
And I couldn't be sure <br />
I had a feeling so peculiar <br />
This pain wouldn't be for <br />
Evermore <br />
Evermore (evermore) <br />
Evermore <br />
This pain wouldn't be for evermore (evermore) <br />
Evermore <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
There were sort of a double meaning to the months and the feelings that are mentioned. One of the meanings is that I wrote this song and these lyrics when we were coming up to the election and I didn’t know what was going to happen. I was almost preparing for the worst to happen, and trying to see some sort of glimmer at the end of the tunnel. The song goes through walking in the forest barefoot in the middle of winter, or standing on a balcony and letting the icy wind just hit you, and you’re catching your death and then, in the last chorus, the person goes inside and finally is warm and safe. It’s about sort of the process of finding hope again, but it also reflected back to an experience that I had that was pretty life-altering, when I went through a bunch of bad stuff in 2016. July, November, during all those times, I was just taking it day by day to get through, trying to find a glimmer of hope, all of that. So, I was coming from both of those perspectives. We wrote it exactly the same way we wrote “exile”, where Joe wrote the piano, I based the vocal melody on the piano, and we sent it to Justin, who then added that bridge. Joe had written the piano part so that the tempo speeds up, and it changes, the music completely changes to a different tempo in the bridge, and Justin really latched onto that, and just 100% embraced it and wrote this beautiful sort of the clutter of all your anxieties in your head, and they’re all speaking at once. When we got the bridge back, I wrote this narrative of ‘When I was shipwrecked, I thought of you,’ that sort of thing, where there was this beacon of hope and then, in the end, you realized the pain wouldn’t be forever, that it could get better. - Taylor Swift
