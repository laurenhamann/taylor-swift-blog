<p className="verse-one">
You booked the night train for a reason <br />          
So you could sit there in this hurt <br />  
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers <br />  
You're not sure which is worse <br />  
Because I dropped your hand while dancing <br />  
Left you out there standing <br />  
Crestfallen on the landing <br />  
Champagne problems <br />  
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Your mom's ring in your pocket <br />  
My picture in your wallet <br />  
Your heart was glass, I dropped it <br />  
Champagne problems <br />  
You told your family for a reason <br />  
You couldn't keep it in <br />  
Your sister splashed out on the bottle <br />  
Now no one's celebrating <br />  
Dom Pérignon, you brought it <br />  
No crowd of friends applauded <br />  
Your hometown skeptics called it <br />  
Champagne problems <br />  
You had a speech, you're speechless <br />  
Love slipped beyond your reaches <br />  
And I couldn't give a reason <br />  
Champagne problems <br />  
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door <br />  
November flush and your flannel cure <br />  
"This dorm was once a madhouse" <br />  
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me" <br />  
How evergreen, our group of friends <br />  
Don't think we'll say that word again <br />  
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls <br />  
That we once walked through <br />  
One for the money, two for the show <br />  
I never was ready, so I watch you go <br />  
Sometimes you just don't know the answer <br />  
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you <br />  
"She would've made such a lovely bride <br />  
What a shame she's fucked in the head, " they said <br />  
But you'll find the real thing instead <br />  
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred <br />  
</p>
<p className="outro">
And hold your hand while dancing <br />  
Never leave you standing <br />  
Crestfallen on the landing <br />  
With champagne problems <br />  
Your mom's ring in your pocket <br />  
Her picture in your wallet <br />  
You won't remember all my <br />  
Champagne problems <br />  
You won't remember all my <br />  
Champagne problems <br />
