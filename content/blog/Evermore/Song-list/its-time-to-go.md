<p className="verse-one">
… When your dinner is cold and the chatter gets old <br />
You ask for the tab <br />
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends <br />
Look at each other like that <br />
… When the words of a sister come back in whispers <br />
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed <br />
Not a twin from your dreams <br />
She's a crook who was caught <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
… That old familiar body ache <br />
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul <br />
You know when it's time to go <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
… 20 years at your job <br />
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours <br />
Or trying to stay for the kids <br />
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
… That old familiar body ache <br />
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul <br />
You know when it's time to go <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
… Sometimes giving up is the strong thing <br />
Sometimes to run is the brave thing <br />
Sometimes walking out is the one thing <br />
That will find you the right thing <br />
… Sometimes giving up is the strong thing <br />
Sometimes to run is the brave thing <br />
Sometimes walking out is the one thing <br />
That will find you the right thing <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
… 15 years, 15 million tears <br />
Begging 'til my knees bled <br />
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all <br />
Then wondered why I left <br />
… Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones <br />
Praying to his greed <br />
He's got my past frozen behind glass <br />
But I've got me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
… That old familiar body ache <br />
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul <br />
I know when it's time to go <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
… Sometimes giving up is the strong thing <br />
Sometimes to run is the brave thing <br />
Sometimes walking out is the one thing <br />
That will find you the right thing <br />
… Sometimes giving up is the strong thing <br />
Sometimes to run is the brave thing <br />
Sometimes walking out is the one thing <br />
That will find you the right thing <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
… That will find you the right thing <br />
And you know in your soul <br />
And you know in your soul <br />
When it's time to go <br />
… You know, you know, you know, you know <br />
When it's time to go <br />
… So then you go <br />
Then you go <br />
You just go <br />
</p>
