<p className="verse-one">
Fatefully<br />
I tried to pick my battles<br />
'Til the battle picked me<br />
Misery<br />
Like the war of words, I shouted in my sleep<br />
And you passed right by<br />
I was in the alley surrounded on all sides<br />
The knife cuts both ways<br />
If the shoe fits, walk in it<br />
'Til your high heels break<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I fell from the pedestal<br />
Right down the rabbit hole<br />
Long story short, it was a bad time<br />
Pushed from the precipice<br />
Clung to the nearest lips<br />
Long story short, it was the wrong guy<br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Now I'm all about you<br />
I'm all about you, I<br />
Yeah, yeah<br />
I'm all about you, I<br />
Yeah, yeah<br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Actually<br />
I always felt I must look better in the rearview<br />
Missing me<br />
At the golden gates, they once held the keys to<br />
When I dropped my sword<br />
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door<br />
And we live in peace<br />
But if someone comes at us<br />
This time I'm ready<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I fell from the pedestal<br />
Right down the rabbit hole<br />
Long story short, it was a bad time<br />
Pushed from the precipice<br />
Clung to the nearest lips<br />
Long story short, it was the wrong guy<br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Now I'm all about you<br />
I'm all about you, I<br />
Yeah, yeah<br />
I'm all about you<br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
No more keeping score<br />
Now I just keep you warm (keep you warm)<br />
No more tug of war now<br />
I just know there's more (know there's more)<br />
No more keeping score<br />
Now I just keep you warm (keep you warm)<br />
And my waves meet your shore<br />
Ever and evermore<br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Past me<br />
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things<br />
Your nemeses will defeat themselves<br />
Before you get the chance to swing<br />
And he's passing by<br />
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky<br />
And he feels like home<br />
If the shoe fits, walk in it<br />
Everywhere you go<br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I fell from the pedestal<br />
Right down the rabbit hole<br />
Long story short, it was a bad time<br />
Pushed from the precipice<br />
Climbed right back up the cliff<br />
Long story short, I survived<br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Now I'm all about you (now)<br />
I'm all about you, I (now)<br />
I'm all about you (now)<br />
I'm all about you, I<br />
Yeah, yeah<br />
I'm all about you (now)<br />
Yeah, yeah<br />
I'm all about you<br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Long story short, it was a bad time<br />
Long story short, I survived<br />
</p>
