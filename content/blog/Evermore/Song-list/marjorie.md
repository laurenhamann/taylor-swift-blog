<p className="verse-one">
Never be so kind, you forget to be clever <br />
Never be so clever, you forget to be kind <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And if I didn't know better <br />
I'd think you were talking to me now <br />
If I didn't know better <br />
I'd think you were still around <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What died didn't stay dead <br />
What died didn't stay dead <br />
You're alive, you're alive in my head <br />
What died didn't stay dead <br />
What died didn't stay dead <br />
You're alive, so alive <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Never be so polite, you forget your power <br />
Never wield such power, you forget to be polite <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And if I didn't know better <br />
I'd think you were listening to me now <br />
If I didn't know better <br />
I'd think you were still around <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What died didn't stay dead <br />
What died didn't stay dead <br />
You're alive, you're alive in my head <br />
What died didn't stay dead <br />
What died didn't stay dead <br />
You're alive, so alive <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
The autumn chill that wakes me up <br />
You loved the amber skies so much <br />
Long limbs and frozen swims <br />
You'd always go past where our feet could touch <br />
And I complained the whole way there <br />
The car ride back and up the stairs <br />
I should've asked you questions <br />
I should've asked you how to be <br />
Asked you to write it down for me <br />
Should've kept every grocery store receipt <br />
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me <br />
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie <br />
All your closets of backlogged dreams <br />
And how you left them all to me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
What died didn't stay dead <br />
What died didn't stay dead <br />
You're alive, you're alive in my head <br />
What died didn't stay dead <br />
What died didn't stay dead <br />
You're alive, so alive <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
And if I didn't know better <br />
I'd think you were singing to me now <br />
If I didn't know better <br />
I'd think you were still around <br />
I know better <br />
But I still feel you all around <br />
I know better <br />
But you're still around <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
The experience writing that song was really surreal, because I was kind of a wreck at times writing it, and I’d sort of breakdown sometimes. It was really hard to actually even sing it in the vocal booth without sounding like I had sort of a break [in my voice], because it just was really emotional. I think that one of the hardest forms of regret to sort of work through is the regret of being so young when you lost someone that you didn’t have the perspective to learn and appreciate who they were fully. I’d open up my grandmother’s closet and she had beautiful dresses from the 60s, I wish I’d asked her where she wore every single one of them, things like that. She was a singer and my mom would look at me so many times a year and say, ‘God, you’re just like her,’ when I’ll do some manners that I don’t recognize as being anyone other than mine. She died when I was 13, and she died, I think, when I was on a trip to Nashville to try and make it, to try to hand out my demos and CDs to record labels and things like that, so there were pretty insane coincidences like that, and I’ve always felt that thing like she was seeing this, because we have sort of to do that. One of the things on this song that still rips me apart when I listen to it is that she’s singing with me on this song. My mum found a bunch of her old records, a bunch of old vinyls of her singing opera, and I sent them to Aaron and he added them to the song. It says ‘If I didn’t know better, I’d think you were singing to me now’, and then you actually hear Marjorie, my grandmother, actually sing. And it’s moments like that on the record that just make you feel like your whole heart is in this whole thing that you’re doing. Is all of you that you put into these things. - Taylor Swift
