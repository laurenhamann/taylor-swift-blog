<p className="verse-one">
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night <br />
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife <br />
And if it was an open-shut case <br />
I never would've known from that look on your face <br />
Lost in your current like a priceless wine <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
The more that you say <br />
The less I know <br />
Wherever you stray <br />
I follow <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh) <br />
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in <br />
As if you were a mythical thing <br />
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring <br />
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
The more that you say <br />
The less I know <br />
Wherever you stray <br />
I follow <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
You know that my train could take you home <br />
Anywhere else is hollow <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh) <br />
They count me out time and time again <br />
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh) <br />
But I come back stronger than a 90's trend <br />
Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark <br />
Show me the places where the others gave you scars <br />
Now this is an open-shut case <br />
Guess I should've known from the look on your face <br />
Every bait and switch was a work of art <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
The more that you say <br />
The less I know <br />
Wherever you stray <br />
I follow <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
You know that my train could take you home <br />
Anywhere else is hollow <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
The more that you say <br />
The less I know <br />
Wherever you stray <br />
I follow <br />
Begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
You know that my train could take you home <br />
Anywhere else is hollow <br />
Begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
Hey, that's my man <br />
That's my man <br />
Yeah, that's my man <br />
Every bait and switch was a work of art <br />
That's my man <br />
Hey, that's my man <br />
I'm begging for you to take my hand <br />
Wreck my plans <br />
That's my man <br />
