<p className="verse-one">
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you <br />
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and <br />
You know it's all the same, another time and place <br />
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it <br />
But I believe in whatever you do <br />
And I'll do anything to see it through <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Because these things will change <br />
Can you feel it now? <br />
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down <br />
It's a revolution, the time will come <br />
For us to finally win <br />
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
So we've been outnumbered <br />
Raided and now cornered <br />
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair <br />
We're getting stronger now <br />
Find things they never found <br />
They might be bigger <br />
But we're faster and never scared <br />
You can walk away, say we don't need this <br />
But there's something in your eyes <br />
Says we can beat this <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Because these things will change <br />
Can you feel it now? <br />
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down <br />
It's a revolution, the time will come <br />
For us to finally win <br />
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees <br />
Fight for what we've worked for all these years <br />
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives <br />
But we'll stand up champions tonight <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
It was the night things changed <br />
Can you see it now? <br />
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down <br />
It's a revolution, throw your hands up <br />
'Cause we never gave in <br />
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah <br />
Hallelujah <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
I wrote the song ‘Change’ as an underdog story. It’s kind of crazy to think that the Olympics chose this as one of the songs to play during the Olympic Games. That blew my mind, because what I actually wrote this song about was being on a small record label. When you’re at a record label that had 12 employees, you have to work harder to get on major tours. You have to work harder to get presenter slots or performer slots on award shows. There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When are we going to get a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’ I wrote the beginning to this song, and I thought someday things are going to be different. I finished the song the night that I won the Horizon Award at the CMA Awards and looked over and saw the president of my tiny, little record label crying. - Taylor Swift
