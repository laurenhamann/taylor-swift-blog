<p className="verse-one">
Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye <br />
And we caught onto something <br />
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me <br />
Were you just kidding? <br />
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down <br />
We almost never speak <br />
I don't feel welcome anymore <br />
Baby what happened? Please tell me <br />
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called <br />
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all <br />
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always" <br />
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom <br />
Everything is wrong <br />
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone <br />
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always" <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Was I out of line? <br />
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide <br />
Like a scared little boy <br />
I looked into your eyes <br />
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure <br />
So here's to everything coming down to nothing <br />
Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core <br />
Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called <br />
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all <br />
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always" <br />
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom <br />
Everything is wrong <br />
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone <br />
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always" <br />
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh back up, baby, back up <br />
Did you forget everything? <br />
Back up, baby, back up <br />
Did you forget everything? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause it rains in your bedroom <br />
Everything is wrong <br />
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone <br />
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always" <br />
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called <br />
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all <br />
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always" <br />
And it rains in your bedroom <br />
Everything is wrong <br />
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone <br />
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always" <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
You didn't mean it baby, <br />
You said, "Forever and always", yeah. <br />
</p>
