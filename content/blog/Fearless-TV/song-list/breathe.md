<p className="verse-one">
I see your face in my mind as I drive away <br />
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way <br />
People are people and sometimes we change our minds <br />
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time <br />
</p>
<p className="break">
Mm-mmm, mm-mm-mm-mmm <br />
Mm-mmm, mm-mm-mm-mmm <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie <br />
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see <br />
'Cause it's tragedy, and it'll only bring you down <br />
Now I don't know what to be without you around <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And we know it's never simple, never easy <br />
Never a clean break, no one here to save me <br />
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to <br />
Breathe without you, but I have to <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt <br />
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve <br />
People are people and sometimes it doesn't work out <br />
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And we know it's never simple, never easy <br />
Never a clean break, no one here to save me <br />
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to <br />
Breathe without you, but I have to <br />
It's 2 a.m., feeling like I just lost a friend <br />
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me <br />
It's 2 a.m., feeling like I just lost a friend <br />
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And we know it's never simple, never easy <br />
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I can't breathe without you, but I have to <br />
Breathe without you, but I have to <br />
Breathe without you, but I have to <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm) <br />
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (yeah) <br />
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry (ooh) <br />
</p>

## Quote from Artist

<blockquote>
The song ‘Breathe’ is a song about having to let go of someone in your life who you care about, and you don’t want to hurt, but you’ve outgrown the friendship or the relationship. And I wrote the idea for it, and Colbie Caillat was in town who’s just one of my favorite artists, I absolutely love her music and I love her voice. And she was in town playing a show and I brought her this idea and she really liked it, and we wrote it together. We sat there and wrote the song right before her show. I mean, it was the afternoon, she was about to play that night. And she sang backup vocals on it that are just so haunting. And I’m so lucky because she agreed to do the same backup vocals on my version of ‘Breathe.’ So, it absolutely would not have been the same without her. I’m really, really grateful that she decided to return to the project.- Taylor Swift

<blockquote>
She knows a lot about every person she’s in the room with and genuinely has an interest. She makes you feel like she loves your work and she has known you forever. I just remember she was so young, and the song she came in with, it was just beautiful. I had so much respect for her. I think the song that we did, it was a really special thing. She was writing about something she was going through with a band member at the time, and she was pouring her heart out about it. - Colbie Caillat
