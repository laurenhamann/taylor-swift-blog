<p className="verse-one">
I could go back to every laugh <br />
But I don't wanna go there anymore <br />
And I know all the steps up to your door <br />
But I don't wanna go there anymore <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky <br />
Talk to the man with the reasons why <br />
And let me know what you find <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'll leave my window open <br />
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name <br />
Just know I'm right here hoping <br />
That you'll come in with the rain <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I could stand up and sing you a song <br />
But I don't wanna have to go that far <br />
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart <br />
And you don't even know where I start <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears <br />
Talk to the man who put you here <br />
And don't wait for the sky to clear <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'll leave my window open <br />
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name, oh <br />
Just know I'm right here hoping <br />
That you'll come in with the rain <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I've watched you so long, screamed your name <br />
I don't know what else I can say <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I'll leave my window open <br />
'Cause I'm too tired tonight for all these games <br />
Just know I'm right here hoping <br />
That you'll come in with the rain <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
I could go back to every laugh <br />
But I don't wanna go there anymore <br />
</p>
