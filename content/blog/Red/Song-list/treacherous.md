<p className="verse-one">
Put your lips close to mine <br />
As long as they don't touch <br />
Out of focus, eye to eye <br />
'Til the gravity's too much <br />
And I'll do anything you say <br />
If you say it with your hands <br />
And I'd be smart to walk away <br />
But you're quicksand <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This slope is treacherous <br />
This path is reckless <br />
This slope is treacherous <br />
And I, I, I like it <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I can't decide if it's a choice <br />
Getting swept away <br />
I hear the sound of my own voice <br />
Asking you to stay <br />
And all we are is skin and bone <br />
Trained to get along <br />
Forever going with the flow <br />
But you're friction <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This slope is treacherous <br />
This path is reckless <br />
This slope is treacherous <br />
I, I, I like it <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night <br />
And I will get you, and get you alone <br />
Your name has echoed through my mind <br />
And I just think you should, think you should know <br />
That nothing safe is worth the drive <br />
And I would follow you, follow you home <br />
I'll follow you, follow you home <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This hope is treacherous <br />
This daydream is dangerous <br />
This hope is treacherous <br />
I, I, I <br />
I, I, I <br />
I, I, I <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night <br />
And I will get you, and get you alone <br />
Your name has echoed through my mind <br />
And I just think you should, think you should know <br />
That nothing safe is worth the drive <br />
And I will follow you, follow you home <br />
I'll follow you, follow you home <br />
I'll follow you, follow you home <br />
I'll follow you, follow you home <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
This slope is treacherous <br />
I, I, I like it <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist
<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj1WllQRkxo">
“Treacherous” is a song that I wrote with Dan Wilson. I brought in this idea because I wanted to explore the idea that something could be dangerous and enticing at the same time, the positive side of that, like, “I believe this can work”. It’s got this big bridge at the end of it that kind of sounds like a second chorus, it’s got all these vocals in the background and it says “Nothing safe is worth the drive” and, to me, that says so much about this album, because I really do feel that, even if something really hurt you, if it made you feel something, it was worth it.
- Taylor Swift
