<p className="verse-one">
Took a deep breath in the mirror <br />
He didn't like it when I wore high heels <br />
But I do <br />
Turn the lock and put my headphones on <br />
He always said he didn't get this song <br />
But I do, I do <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Walked in expecting you'd be late <br />
But you got here early and you stand and wave <br />
I walk to you <br />
You pull my chair out and help me in <br />
And you don't know how nice that is <br />
But I do <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And you throw your head back laughing <br />
Like a little kid <br />
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny, 'cause <br />
He never did <br />
I've been spending the last eight months <br />
Thinking all love ever does <br />
Is break and burn, and end <br />
But on a Wednesday in a cafe <br />
I watched it begin again <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
You said you never met one girl who had <br />
As many James Taylor records as you <br />
But I do <br />
We tell stories and you don't know why <br />
I'm coming off a little shy <br />
But I do <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But you throw your head back laughing <br />
Like a little kid <br />
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny, 'cause <br />
He never did <br />
I've been spending the last eight months <br />
Thinking all love ever does <br />
Is break and burn, and end <br />
But on a Wednesday in a cafe <br />
I watched it begin again <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And we walked down the block, to my car <br />
And I almost brought him up <br />
But you start to talk about the movies <br />
That your family watches every single Christmas <br />
And I want to talk about that <br />
And for the first time <br />
What's past is past <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause you throw your head back laughing <br />
Like a little kid <br />
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny, 'cause <br />
He never did <br />
I've been spending the last eight months <br />
Thinking all love ever does <br />
Is break and burn, and end <br />
But on a Wednesday in a cafe <br />
I watched it begin again <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
But on a Wednesday in a cafe <br />
I watched it begin again <br />

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
Begin Again is a song that I wrote about getting through a breakup, and still being sad about it, and feeling a little insecure about all the things that relationship made you feel are wrong with yourself. And after months, and months, and months, having the courage to stand back up, dust yourself off, and go on that first date. And it’s about, kind of, the vulnerability involved with that, and the idea that you realize that, ‘wow, this could be great.’ - Taylor Swift

<blockquote>
It’s about when you’ve gotten through a really bad relationship and you finally dust yourself off and go on that first date after a horrible breakup, and the vulnerability that goes along with all that. - Taylor Swift
