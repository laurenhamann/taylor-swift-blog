<p className="verse-one">
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street <br />
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly <br />
Loving him is like trying to change your mind <br />
Once you're already flying through the free fall <br />
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Losing him was blue like I'd never known <br />
Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br />
Forgetting him was like tryin' know somebody you never met <br />
But loving him was red <br />
Loving him was red <br />
</p>
<p className='verse-two'>
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted <br />
Was right there in front of you <br />
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words <br />
To your old favorite song <br />
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword <br />
And realizing there's no right answer <br />
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out <br />
That love could be that strong <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Losing him was blue like I'd never known <br />
Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br />
Forgetting him was like tryin' know somebody you never met <br />
But loving him was red <br />
Oh, red <br />
Burning red <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes <br />
Tell myself, "It's time now, gotta let go" <br />
But moving on from him is impossible <br />
When I still see it all in my head <br />
In burning red <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Loving him was red <br />
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known <br />
Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br />
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know <br />
Somebody you never met <br />
'Cause loving him was red <br />
Yeah, yeah, red <br />
We're burning red <br />
</p>
<p className='outro'>
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head <br />
Comes back to me, burning red <br />
Yeah, yeah <br />
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street <br />
</p>
