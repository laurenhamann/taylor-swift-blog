<p className="verse-one">
It feels like a perfect night <br />
To dress up like hipsters <br />
And make fun of our exes <br />
Ah-ah, ah-ah <br />
It feels like a perfect night <br />
For breakfast at midnight <br />
To fall in love with strangers <br />
Ah-ah, ah-ah <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time <br />
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah <br />
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines <br />
It's time, oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I don't know about you <br />
But I'm feeling 22 <br />
Everything will be alright if <br />
You keep me next to you <br />
You don't know about me <br />
But I'll bet you want to <br />
Everything will be alright if <br />
We just keep dancing like we're 22, 22 <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
It seems like one of those nights <br />
This place is too crowded <br />
Too many cool kids <br />
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew) Ah-ah, ah-ah <br />
It seems like one of those nights <br />
We ditch the whole scene <br />
And end up dreamin' instead of sleeping, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way <br />
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah <br />
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks <br />
It's time, oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I don't know about you <br />
But I'm feeling 22 <br />
Everything will be alright if <br />
You keep me next to you <br />
You don't know about me <br />
But I'll bet you want to <br />
Everything will be alright if <br />
We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh) <br />
22 <br />
I don't know about you <br />
22, 22 <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
It feels like one of those nights <br />
We ditch the whole scene <br />
It feels like one of those nights <br />
We won't be sleeping <br />
It feels like one of those nights <br />
You look like bad news <br />
I gotta have you <br />
I gotta have you <br />
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I don't know about you <br />
But I'm feeling 22 <br />
Everything will be alright if (Ooh) <br />
You keep me next to you <br />
You don't know about me <br />
But I'll bet you want to <br />
Everything will be alright if <br />
We just keep dancing like we're 22 <br />
22 (Dancing like) <br />
22 (Yeah, yeah) <br />
22 (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br />
It feels like one of those nights <br />
We ditch the whole scene <br />
It feels like one of those nights <br />
We won't be sleeping <br />
It feels like one of those nights <br />
You look like bad news <br />
I gotta have you <br />
I gotta have you <br />
