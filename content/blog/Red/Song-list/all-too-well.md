<p className="verse-one">
I walked through the door with you <br />
The air was cold <br />
But something about it felt like home somehow <br />
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house <br />
And you've still got it in your drawer even now <br />
Oh, your sweet disposition <br />
And my wide-eyed gaze <br />
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate <br />
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place <br />
And I can picture it after all these days <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more <br />
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause there we are again on that little town street <br />
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me <br />
Wind in my hair, I was there <br />
I remember it all too well <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Photo album on the counter <br />
Your cheeks were turning red <br />
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed <br />
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team <br />
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do <br />
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night <br />
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light  <br />
Down the stairs, I was there <br />
I remember it all too well, yeah  <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And maybe we got lost in translation <br />
Maybe I asked for too much <br />
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up <br />
Running scared, I was there <br />
I remember it all too well <br />
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise <br />
So casually cruel in the name of being honest <br />
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here <br />
'Cause I remember it all, all, all <br />
Too well <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it<br />
I'd like to be my old self again<br />
But I'm still trying to find it<br />
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own <br />
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone <br />
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week <br />
'Cause it reminds you of innocence <br />
And it smells like me <br />
You can't get rid of it <br />
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so <br />
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known <br />
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all <br />
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all <br />
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj1WllQRkxo">
The song “All Too Well” was the first song I wrote for this record, actually. It kept coming back to me, because it told a story so well, in such a full way. It starts with meeting someone, and all the details about that innocent beginning and it follows the story all the way to the bitter end. It’s a really emotional song, because it does show you why loss is so painful: Because it was once good, and you can remember it. - Taylor Swift
