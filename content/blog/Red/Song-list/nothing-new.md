<p className="verse-one">
They tell you while you're young <br />
"Girls, go out and have your fun" <br />
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it <br />
Criticize the way you fly when you're soarin' through the sky <br />
Shoots you down and then they sigh, and say <br />
"She looks like she's been through it" <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Lord, what will become of me <br />
Once I've lost my novelty? <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I've had too much to drink tonight <br />
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about <br />
And I wake up in the middle of the night <br />
It's like I can feel time moving <br />
How can a person know everything at 18 but nothing at 22? <br />
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
How long will it be cute <br />
All this crying in my room <br />
Whеn you can't blame it on my youth <br />
And roll your eyes with affеction? <br />
And my cheeks are growing tired <br />
From turning red and faking smiles <br />
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention? <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And someone else lights up the room? <br />
People love an ingénue <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight <br />
How did I go from growing up to breaking down? <br />
And I wake up (wake up) in the middle of the night <br />
It's like I can feel time moving <br />
How can a person know everything at 18 but nothing at 22? <br />
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new? <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream <br />
The kind of radiance you only have at 17 <br />
She'll know the way, and then she'll say she got the map from me <br />
I'll say I'm happy for her, then I'll cry myself to sleep <br />
Oh, whoa, whoa <br />
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, whoa, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight <br />
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out <br />
I wake up (wake up) in the middle of the night <br />
And I can feel time moving <br />
How can a person know everything at 18 but nothing at 22? <br />
And will you still want me <br />
Will you still want me <br />
Will you still want me <br />
When I'm nothing new? <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
It’s about being scared of aging and things changing and losing what you have. […] It’s a really vulnerable song, but I think it’s important to say.
- Taylor Swift
