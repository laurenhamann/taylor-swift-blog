<p className="verse-one">
New to town with a made-up name <br />
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame <br />
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream <br />
You had it figured out since you were in school <br />
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool <br />
So overnight, you look like a '60s queen <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Another name goes up in lights <br />
Like diamonds in the sky <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
But can you tell me now you're the lucky one? <br />
Oh, oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Now it's big black cars and Riviera views <br />
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you <br />
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page <br />
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused <br />
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used <br />
And all the young things line up to take your place <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Another name goes up in lights <br />
You wonder if you'll make it out alive <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Can you tell me now you're the lucky one? <br />
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh <br />
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-three">
It was a few years later, I showed up here <br />
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared <br />
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out <br />
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere <br />
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square <br />
And it took some time, but I understand it now <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause now my name is up in lights <br />
But I think you got it right <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Oh, oh, oh <br />
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br />
Oh, oh, oh <br />
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
The ‘Lucky One’ is a song I wrote while I was in Australia. It kind of talks about some of my fears through telling the story of other people that I was inspired by. More than their stories being told, I’m pretty much singing about what I’m scared of in that song, ending up kind of caught up in this whole thing and lonely and feeling misunderstood and feeling like when people think you’re lucky that you’re really not. It kind of expresses my greatest fear of having this not end up being fun anymore, having it end up being a scary place. Some people get there, some people end up there. It’s a story song and it’s something I’m really proud of because it kind of goes to a place that I’m terrified of.

Being famous can be fun at first, but people have ended up in a scary place over time. Everybody’s got their way of dealing with it. And for me, sometimes it’s surrounding myself with my friends and venting, sometimes it’s staying up at the piano until four o'clock in the morning, sometimes it’s watching TV and forgetting about all of it, sometimes it’s calling my mother up and crying. Sometimes you have a really bad day.

Your life is constantly also analyzed. There’s a lot of trade-offs. There’s the microscope that’s always on you. The camera flashes, the fear that something you say will be taken the wrong way and you’ll let your fans down. There’s the fear that you’ll be walking down the street and your skirt will blow up and you’ll be in the news for three months.

You’re scared of a lot of things for a lot of the time, but the trade-off of being able to get on a big stage and sing your songs — it’s worth it." - Taylor Swift
