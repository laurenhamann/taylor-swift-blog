<p className="verse-one">
Once upon a time <br />
A few mistakes ago <br />
I was in your sights <br />
You got me alone <br />
You found me <br />
You found me <br />
You found me <br />
I guess you didn't care <br />
And I guess I liked that <br />
And when I fell hard  <br />
You took a step back <br />
Without me <br />
Without me <br />
Without me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And he's long gone <br />
When he's next to me <br />
And I realize <br />
The blame is on me <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in  <br />
So shame on me now <br />
Flew me to places I'd never been <br />
'Til you put me down, oh <br />
I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br />
So, shame on me now <br />
Flew me to places I'd never been <br />
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground <br />
Oh, oh <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
Oh, oh <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
No apologies <br />
He'll never see you cry <br />
Pretends he doesn't know <br />
That he's the reason why <br />
You're drowning <br />
You're drowning <br />
You're drowning <br />
And I heard you moved on <br />
From whispers on the street <br />
A new notch in your belt <br />
Is all I'll ever be <br />
And now I see <br />
Now I see <br />
Now I see <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
He was long gone <br />
When he met me <br />
And I realize <br />
The joke is on me, hey  <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)  <br />
So shame on me now <br />
Flew me to places I'd never been <br />
'Til you put me down, oh <br />
I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br />
So shame on me now <br />
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah <br />
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground <br />
Oh, oh (yeah) <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
Oh, oh <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And the saddest fear <br />
Comes creepin' in <br />
That you never loved me <br />
Or her <br />
Or anyone <br />
Or anything <br />
Yeah <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br />
So shame on me now <br />
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been) <br />
'Til you put me down, oh <br />
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew it right there) <br />
So shame on me now (knew it right there) <br />
Flew me to places I'd never been <br />
(Ooh) now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground <br />
Oh, oh <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble (oh) <br />
Oh, oh <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br />
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.mtv.com/news/etqqne/taylor-swift-i-knew-you-were-trouble">
Itâ€™s a song about kind of being frustrated with yourself because you have your heart broken and you knew when you first saw that person you saw all these red flags and you just went for it anyway. So, shame on me. - Taylor Swift
