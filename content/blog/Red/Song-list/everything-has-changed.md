<p className="intro">
You good to go? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
All I knew <br />
This morning when I woke <br />
Is I know something now <br />
Know something now I didn't before <br />
And all I've seen <br />
Since eighteen hours ago <br />
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile <br />
In the back of my mind making me feel like <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now  <br />
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you, know you, know you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello" <br />
And your eyes look like comin' home <br />
All I know is a simple name <br />
And everything has changed <br />
All I know is you held the door <br />
You'll be mine and I'll be yours <br />
All I know since yesterday <br />
Is everything has changed <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
And all my walls <br />
Stood tall painted blue <br />
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down <br />
And open up the door for you <br />
And all I feel <br />
In my stomach is butterflies <br />
The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time <br />
Takin' flight, makin' me feel like <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you, know you, know you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello" <br />
And your eyes look like comin' home <br />
All I know is a simple name <br />
Everything has changed <br />
All I know is you held the door <br />
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours <br />
All I know since yesterday <br />
Is everything has changed <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Come back and tell me why <br />
I'm feelin' like I've missed you all this time <br />
And meet me there tonight <br />
And let me know that it's not all in my mind <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you, know you, know you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All I know is we said, "Hello" <br />
Your eyes look like comin' home <br />
All I know is a simple name <br />
And everything has changed <br />
All I know is you held the door <br />
You'll be mine and I'll be yours <br />
All I know since yesterday <br />
Is everything has changed <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
All I know is we said, "Hello" <br />
So dust off your highest hopes <br />
All I know is pouring rain <br />
And everything has changed <br />
All I know is a new found grace <br />
All my days, I'll know your face <br />
All I know since yesterday <br />
Is everything has changed <br />
</p>
