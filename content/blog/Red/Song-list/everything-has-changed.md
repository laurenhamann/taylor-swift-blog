<p className="intro">
You good to go? <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
All I knew <br />
This morning when I woke <br />
Is I know something now <br />
Know something now I didn't before <br />
And all I've seen <br />
Since eighteen hours ago <br />
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile <br />
In the back of my mind making me feel like <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now  <br />
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you, know you, know you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello" <br />
And your eyes look like comin' home <br />
All I know is a simple name <br />
And everything has changed <br />
All I know is you held the door <br />
You'll be mine and I'll be yours <br />
All I know since yesterday <br />
Is everything has changed <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
And all my walls <br />
Stood tall painted blue <br />
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down <br />
And open up the door for you <br />
And all I feel <br />
In my stomach is butterflies <br />
The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time <br />
Takin' flight, makin' me feel like <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you, know you, know you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello" <br />
And your eyes look like comin' home <br />
All I know is a simple name <br />
Everything has changed <br />
All I know is you held the door <br />
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours <br />
All I know since yesterday <br />
Is everything has changed <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Come back and tell me why <br />
I'm feelin' like I've missed you all this time <br />
And meet me there tonight <br />
And let me know that it's not all in my mind <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now <br />
I just wanna know you, know you, know you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
All I know is we said, "Hello" <br />
Your eyes look like comin' home <br />
All I know is a simple name <br />
And everything has changed <br />
All I know is you held the door <br />
You'll be mine and I'll be yours <br />
All I know since yesterday <br />
Is everything has changed <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
All I know is we said, "Hello" <br />
So dust off your highest hopes <br />
All I know is pouring rain <br />
And everything has changed <br />
All I know is a new found grace <br />
All my days, I'll know your face <br />
All I know since yesterday <br />
Is everything has changed <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj1WllQRkxo">
“Everything Has Changed” is a song that I wrote with Ed Sheeran. He is such a talented person, in so many ways. He’s such an incredibly talented guitar player, singer, songwriter, performer… Writing this song with him was so much fun, because we were sitting at my backyard writing this song, and he started singing harmony on it and I asked him if he would record it with me as a duet. Because it’s about this moment that both people are having where they see each other and, all of a sudden, the world looks different ‘cause everything changed. - Taylor Swift
