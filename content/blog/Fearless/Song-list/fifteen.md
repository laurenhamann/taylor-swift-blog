<p className="verse-one">
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors <br />
It's the mornin' of your very first day <br />
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while <br />
Try and stay out of everybody's way <br />
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here <br />
For the next four years in this town <br />
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say <br />
"You know, I haven't seen you around before" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause when you're 15 <br />
And somebody tells you they love you <br />
You're gonna believe them <br />
And when you're 15 <br />
Feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out, well <br />
Count to ten, take it in <br />
This is life before you know who you're gonna be <br />
At 15 <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail <br />
And soon enough, you're best friends <br />
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool <br />
We'll be outta here as soon as we can <br />
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car <br />
And you're feelin' like flyin' <br />
And your mama's waitin' up <br />
And you're thinkin' he's the one <br />
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends <br />
When the night ends <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause when you're 15 <br />
And somebody tells you they love you <br />
You're gonna believe them <br />
And when you're 15 <br />
And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round, well <br />
In your life you'll do things greater than <br />
Dating the boy on the football team <br />
I didn't know it at 15 <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
When all you wanted was to be wanted <br />
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now <br />
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday <br />
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine <br />
And Abigail gave everything she had <br />
To a boy who changed his mind <br />
And we both cried <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause when you're 15 <br />
And somebody tells you they love you <br />
You're gonna believe them <br />
And when you're 15 <br />
Don't forget to look before you fall <br />
I've found time can heal most anything <br />
And you just might find who you're supposed to be <br />
I didn't know who I was supposed to be <br />
At 15 <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la <br />
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la <br />
La-la-la, la-la-la <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Your very first day <br />
Take a deep breath, girl <br />
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors <br />
</p>
