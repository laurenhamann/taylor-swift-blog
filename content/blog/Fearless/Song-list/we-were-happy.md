<p className="verse-one">
We used to walk along the streets <br />
When the porch lights were shinin' bright <br />
Before I had somewhere to be <br />
Back when we had all night <br />
And we were happy <br />
I do recall a good while back <br />
We snuck into the circus <br />
You threw your arms around my neck <br />
Back when I deserved it <br />
And we were happy <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby <br />
We showed 'em all up <br />
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark <br />
Talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday <br />
And we were happy <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
We used to watch the sun go down <br />
On the boats in the water <br />
That's sorta how I feel right now <br />
And goodbye's so much harder <br />
'Cause we were happy <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby <br />
We showed 'em all up <br />
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark <br />
Talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday <br />
And we were happy <br />
We were happy <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Oh, I hate those voices <br />
Tellin' me I'm not in love anymore <br />
But they don't give me choices <br />
And that's what these tears are for <br />
'Cause we were happy <br />
We were happy <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby <br />
We showed 'em all up <br />
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark <br />
Talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm <br />
And you were gonna marry me <br />
And we were happy <br />
We were happy <br />
Oh <br />
We were happy <br />
</p>
