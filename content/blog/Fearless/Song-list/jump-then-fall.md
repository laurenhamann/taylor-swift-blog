<p className="verse-one">
I like the way you sound in the morning <br />
We're on the phone and without a warning <br />
I realize your laugh is the best sound <br />
I have ever heard <br />
I like the way I can't keep my focus <br />
I watch you talk, you didn't notice <br />
I hear the words but all I can think is <br />
We should be together <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Every time you smile, I smile <br />
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you, baby <br />
Don't be afraid to jump then fall <br />
Jump then fall into me <br />
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you <br />
Say that you wanna be with me too <br />
'Cause I'ma stay through it all <br />
So jump then fall <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face <br />
You got the keys to me <br />
I love each freckle on your face, oh <br />
I've never been so wrapped up, honey <br />
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted <br />
I had time to think it o-over <br />
And all I can say is come closer <br />
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause every time you smile, I smile <br />
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you, baby <br />
Don't be afraid to jump then fall <br />
Jump then fall into me <br />
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you <br />
Say that you wanna be with me too <br />
'Cause I'ma stay through it all <br />
So jump then fall <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet <br />
I'll catch you, I'll catch you <br />
When people say things that bring you to your knees <br />
I'll catch you <br />
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry <br />
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Whoa, oh, I need you, baby <br />
Don't be afraid, please <br />
Jump then fall <br />
Jump then fall into me <br />
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you <br />
Say that you wanna be with me too <br />
'Cause I'ma stay through it all <br />
So jump then fall <br />
Jump then fall, baby <br />
Jump then fall into me, into me <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Every time you smile, I smile <br />
And every time you shine, I shine <br />
And every time you're here <br />
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you <br />
You can jump then fall, jump then fall <br />
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah <br />
 <br />
 </p>
