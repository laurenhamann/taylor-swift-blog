<p className="verse-one">
You said, "I know" <br />
When I said, "I need some time, need some space <br />
To think about all of this" <br />
You watched me go <br />
And I knew my words were hard to hear <br />
And harder to ever take back <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And I said, "When can I come back?" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And you said, that's when, when I wake up in the mornin' <br />
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin' <br />
Laughin' when I'm cryin' <br />
And that's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate <br />
That's when, when I see your face <br />
I'll let you in, and baby that's when <br />
Mm-mm <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I said, "I know" <br />
When you said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes <br />
And put you through all of this" (through all of this) <br />
Then through the phone <br />
Came all your tears <br />
And I said "Leave those all in our past" <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
And you said "When can I come back?" <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
And I said, that's when, when I wake up in the mornin' <br />
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin' <br />
Laughin' when I'm cryin' <br />
And that's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate <br />
That's when, when I see your face <br />
I'll let you in, and baby that's when <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And you said, "Honestly <br />
When you were gone, did you ever think of me?" <br />
And I said,
</p>
<p className="chorus">
that's when, when I woke up in the mornin' <br />
That's when it was sunny or stormin' <br />
Laughin' when I was cryin' <br />
And that's when you were waitin' at the front gate <br />
That's when, when I saw your face <br />
You let me in, and baby that's when <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
yeah <br />
(That's when it was sunny or stormin') <br />
When I'm laughin', when I'm cryin' <br />
(That's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate) that's when I miss you <br />
(That's when, when I see your face) <br />
That's when I want you <br />
That's when I love you <br />
That's when <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
We ended up ultimately writing a song about someone who is in love, in a relationship, but just all of a sudden is like, “Wait, I just need some space, I need to think about this”, and kind of leaves, and what does the other person do. - Taylor Swift
