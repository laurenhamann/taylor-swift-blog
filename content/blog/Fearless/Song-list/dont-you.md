<p className="verse-one">
Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere <br />
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare <br />
I heard she's nothin' like me <br />
I'm sure she'll make you happy <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But don't you <br />
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been <br />
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again <br />
You don't know how much I feel I love you still <br />
So why don't you, don't you? <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you <br />
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do <br />
My heart knows what the truth is <br />
I swore I wouldn't do this <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
But don't you <br />
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been <br />
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again <br />
You don't know how much I feel I love you still <br />
So why don't you, don't you? <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
So I walk outta here tonight <br />
Try to go on with my life <br />
And you can say we're still friends <br />
(But I don't wanna pretend) <br />
So if I see you again <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Don't you (don't you) <br />
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been <br />
Don't you (don't you), say you've missed me if you don't want me again <br />
You don't (you don't), know how much I feel I love you still <br />
So why don't you, don't you? <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
Ah, ah, ah, ah <br />
Don't you, ah, ah, ah <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
“Don’t You” is a song that I wrote with Tommy Lee James, who is a fantastic writer. We wrote it about the idea of seeing someone at you used to have a thing for, and seeing them out in public for the first time after you’ve heard that they’ve moved on and that, you know, your life is kind of in shambles, and they have moved on and they’re really happy. And it’s almost like, even them being nice to you hurts you, because you’re like in such a state of pain and you haven’t moved on yet. So that was a really fun song to write because that’s just a wellspring of emotion to draw from, and Jack Antonoff produced it, and I think he did a really, really beautiful job of kind of highlighting sort of the melody and letting it just be really airy and sort of like a dreamscape. - Taylor Swift
