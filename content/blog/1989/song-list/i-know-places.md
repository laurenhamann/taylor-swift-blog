<p className="intro">
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I <br />
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I <br />
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I <br />
I, I, (I, I) <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
You stand with your hand on my waistline <br />
It's a scene, and we're out here in plain sight <br />
I can hear them whisper as we pass by <br />
It's a bad sign, bad sign <br />
Something happens when everybody finds out <br />
See the vultures circling, dark clouds <br />
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out <br />
It could burn out <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes <br />
And guns <br />
They are the hunters, we are the foxes <br />
And we run <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Baby, I know places we won't be found and <br />
They'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down <br />
'Cause I, I know places we can hide <br />
I know places <br />
I know places <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences <br />
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it <br />
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time <br />
Not this time <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it <br />
My love <br />
They are the hunters, we are the foxes <br />
And we run <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Baby, I know places we won't be found and <br />
They'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down <br />
'Cause I, I know places we can hide <br />
I know places <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
They are the hunters, we are the foxes <br />
And we run <br />
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it <br />
My love <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Baby, I know places we won't be found and <br />
They'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down <br />
'Cause I, I know places we can hide <br />
I know places <br />
</p>
<p className="outro">
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof <br />
I know places <br />
(I) and you know for me, it's always you <br />
I know places <br />
(I) in the dead of night, your eyes so green <br />
I know places <br />
(I) and I know for you, it's always me <br />
I know places <br />
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I <br />
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I (I, I, I) <br />
</p>

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
I had this idea of like, you know, when you’re in love – along the lines of ‘Out of the Woods’ – it’s very precious, it’s fragile. As soon as the world gets ahold of it, whether it’s your friends or people around town hear about it … it’s kind of like the first thing people want to do when they hear that people are in love is just kind of try to ruin it […] I kind of was in a place where I was like, ‘No one is gonna sign up for this. There are just too many cameras pointed at me. There are too many ridiculous elaborations on my life. It’s just not ever gonna work.‘ But I decided to write a love song, just kind of like, ‘What would I say if I met someone really awesome and they were like, hey, I’m worried about all this attention you get?’ So I wrote this song called ‘I Know Places’ about, like, ‘Hey, I know places we can hide. We could outrun them.’ I’m so happy that it sounds like the urgency that it sings about. - Taylor Swift
