<p className="verse-one">
Midnight <br />
You come and pick me up, no headlights <br />
Long drive <br />
Could end in burning flames or paradise <br />
Fade into view, oh <br />
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (Heard from you) <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I <br />
Know exactly where it leads but I <br />
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye <br />
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like <br />
And when we go crashing down we come back every time <br />
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style <br />
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt <br />
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt <br />
And when we go crashing down we come back every time <br />
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
So it goes <br />
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road <br />
Takes me home <br />
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat <br />
I say, "I heard, oh <br />
That you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl." <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
He says, "What you've heard is true but I <br />
Can't stop thinking about you." And I <br />
I said, "I've been there too a few times." <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye <br />
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like <br />
And when we go crashing down we come back every time <br />
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style <br />
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt <br />
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt <br />
And when we go crashing down we come back every time <br />
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Take me home <br />
Just take me home, yeah <br />
Just take me home <br />
Out of style <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye <br />
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like <br />
And when we go crashing down we come back every time <br />
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style <br />
</p>



## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
I’m pretty sure when we finished this song I knew the record was done. “Shake It Off” and “Style” were the last two songs to be written for 1989. This one has always been my secret favourite hope — “I hope it ends up being a single”, “I hope people love it”. I love how this song sounds the way that feeling felt. I love when the sound of a song matches the feeling that inspired it — This song just reminds me of driving in the middle of the night. I loved comparing these timeless visuals with a feeling that never goes out of style.

This song is about my life and I’ve never revealed who it’s actually about, but the song kind of speaks for itself, and the way that this song sounds and feels, that’s all I need people to know about that story. - Taylor Swift
