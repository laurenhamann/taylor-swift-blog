<p className="verse-one">
Clear blue water <br />
High tide came and brought you in <br />
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will <br />
Skies grew darker <br />
Currents swept you out again <br />
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
In silent screams <br />
In wildest dreams <br />
I never dreamed of this <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This love is good <br />
This love is bad <br />
This love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh <br />
These hands had to let it go free, and <br />
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh <br />
Ohh <br />
Oh, oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Tossing, turning <br />
Struggled through the night with someone new <br />
And I could go on and on, on and on <br />
Lantern, burning <br />
Flickered in the night, only you <br />
But you were still gone, gone, gone <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
In losing grip <br />
On sinking ships <br />
You showed up just in time <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This love is good <br />
This love is bad <br />
This love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh <br />
These hands had to let it go free, and <br />
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh <br />
This love left a permanent mark <br />
This love is glowing in the dark, oh, oh, oh <br />
These hands had to let it go free, and <br />
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Your kiss, my cheek <br />
I watched you leave <br />
Your smile, my ghost <br />
I fell to my knees <br />
When you're young, you just run <br />
But you come back to what you need <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
This love is good <br />
This love is bad <br />
This love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh  <br />
These hands had to let it go free, and <br />
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh <br />
This love left a permanent mark <br />
This love is glowing in the dark, oh, oh, oh <br />
These hands had to let it go free, and <br />
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh <br />
</p>
<p className="post-chorus">
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh <br />
</p>




## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
I think the one that I kept going back to, over and over and over again, is a song called ‘This Love,’ actually. It’s a song that I wrote by myself. It’s kind of like hypnotic in a way, and it kind of is somewhat romantic and wistful and relaxing. - Taylor Swift
