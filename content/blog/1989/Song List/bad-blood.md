<p className="chorus">
'Cause baby now we got bad blood <br />
You know it used to be mad love <br />
So take a look at what you've done <br />
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood <br />
now we got problems <br />
And I don't think we can solve 'em <br />
You made a really deep cut <br />
And baby, now we got bad blood <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-one">
Did you have to do this? <br />
I was thinking that you could be trusted <br />
Did you have to ruin what was shiny, now it's all rusted <br />
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe <br />
And rub it in so deep <br />
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times <br />
You and I <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood <br />
You know it used to be mad love <br />
So take a look at what you've done <br />
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood <br />
now we got problems <br />
And I don't think we can solve 'em <br />
You made a really deep cut <br />
And baby now we got bad blood <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
did you think we'd be fine? <br />
Still got scars on my back from your knife <br />
So don't think it's in the past <br />
These kind of wounds they last and they last <br />
Now did you think it all through? <br />
All these things will catch up to you <br />
And time can heal but this won't <br />
So if you're coming my way, just don't <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times <br />
You and I <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood <br />
You know it used to be mad love <br />
So take a look what you've done <br />
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood <br />
now we got problems <br />
And I don't think we can solve 'em <br />
You made a really deep cut <br />
And baby, now we got bad blood <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes <br />
You say sorry just for show <br />
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts) <br />
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey) <br />
You say sorry just for show (hey) <br />
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey) <br />
Mmm, if you love like that, blood runs cold <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood <br />
You know it used to be mad love <br />
So take a look what you've done <br />
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (bad blood) <br />
Now we got problems <br />
And I don't think we can solve 'em (think we can solve 'em)  <br />
And baby, now we got bad blood <br />
'cause baby now we got bad blood <br />
You know it used to be mad love <br />
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done) <br />
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (whoa) <br />
Now we got problems <br />
And I don't think we can solve 'em <br />
You made a really deep cut <br />
And baby, now we got bad blood (hey) <br />
</p>


## Quotes from artist

<blockquote>
For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, ‘Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?‘ [In 2013] she did something so horrible. I was like, ‘Oh, we’re just straight-up enemies.’ And it wasn’t even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I’m surprisingly non-confrontational – you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It’s awkward, and I don’t like it. - Taylor Swift
