<p className="verse-one">
One look, dark room <br />
Meant just for you <br />
Time moved too fast <br />
You play it back <br />
Buttons on a coat <br />
Light-hearted joke <br />
No proof, not much <br />
But you saw enough <br />
Small talk, he drives <br />
Coffee at midnight <br />
The light reflects <br />
The chain on your neck <br />
He says, "Look up" <br />
And your shoulders brush <br />
No proof, one touch <br />
But you felt enough <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you <br />
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you <br />
You can see it with the lights out, lights out <br />
You are in love, true love <br />
You are in love <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
Morning, his place <br />
Burnt toast, Sunday <br />
You keep his shirt <br />
He keeps his word <br />
And for once, you let go <br />
Of your fears and your ghosts <br />
One step, not much <br />
But it said enough <br />
You kiss on sidewalks <br />
You fight and you talk <br />
One night he wakes <br />
Strange look on his face <br />
Pauses, then says <br />
You're my best friend <br />
And you knew what it was <br />
He is in love <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you <br />
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you <br />
You can see it with the lights out, lights out <br />
You are in love, true love <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
And so it goes <br />
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round <br />
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown <br />
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars <br />
And why I've spent my whole life tryin' to put it into words <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
'Cause you can hear in the silence <br />
You can feel it on the way home <br />
You can see it with the lights out <br />
You are in love, true love <br />
You are in love <br />
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you <br />
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you <br />
You can see it with the lights out, lights out <br />
You are in love, true love <br />
You are in love <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you <br />
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you <br />
You can see it with the lights out, lights out <br />
You are in love, true love <br />
You are in love <br />
</p>



## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
I’ve never had that, so I wrote that song about things that Lena Dunham has told me about her and Jack Antonoff. That’s just basically stuff she’s told me. And I think that that kind of relationship – God, it sounds like it would just be so beautiful – would also be hard. It would also be mundane at times. - Taylor Swift
