<p className="verse-one">
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow <br />
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats <br />
Everybody here wanted something more <br />
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before <br />
And it said <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Welcome to New York <br />
It's been waiting for you <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
It's been waiting for you <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
It's a new soundtrack <br />
I could dance to this beat, beat <br />
Forevermore <br />
The lights are so bright <br />
But they never blind me, me <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
It's been waiting for you <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors <br />
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer <br />
Everybody here was someone else before <br />
And you can want who you want <br />
Boys and boys and girls and girls <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Welcome to New York <br />
It's been waiting for you <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
It's been waiting for you <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
It's a new soundtrack <br />
I could dance to this beat, beat <br />
Forevermore <br />
The lights are so bright <br />
But they never blind me, me <br />
Welcome to New York (New York) <br />
It's been waiting for you <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing <br />
Like any real love, it's ever-changing <br />
Like any true love, it drives you crazy <br />
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Welcome to New York <br />
It's been waiting for you <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
It's been waiting for you <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
It's a new soundtrack <br />
I could dance to this beat <br />
The lights are so bright <br />
But they never blind me <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
New soundtrack <br />
It's been waiting for you <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
The lights are so bright <br />
But they never blind me <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
So bright, they never blind me <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
Welcome to New York <br />
</p>



## Quotes from artist
<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVKTOX3vMKM&t=55s">
I wanted to start 1989 with this song because New York has been an important landscape and location for the story of my life in the last couple of years. I dreamt and obsessed over moving to New York, and then I did it. The inspiration that I found in that city is hard to describe and to compare to any other force of inspiration I’ve ever experienced in my life. It’s an electric city. - Taylor Swift
