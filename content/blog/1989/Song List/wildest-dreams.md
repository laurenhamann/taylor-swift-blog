<p className="verse-one">
He said, "Let's get out of this town <br />
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds" <br />
I thought Heaven can't help me now <br />
Nothing lasts forever <br />
But this is gonna take me down <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
He's so tall and handsome as hell <br />
He's so bad, but he does it so well <br />
I can see the end as it begins <br />
My one condition is <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Say you'll remember me <br />
Standing in a nice dress <br />
Staring at the sunset, babe <br />
Red lips and rosy cheeks <br />
Say you'll see me again <br />
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha <br />
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha <br />
</p>
<p className="verse-two">
I said, "No one has to know what we do" <br />
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room <br />
And his voice is a familiar sound <br />
Nothing lasts forever <br />
But this is getting good now <br />
</p>
<p className="pre-chorus">
He's so tall and handsome as hell <br />
He's so bad, but he does it so well <br />
And when we've had our very last kiss <br />
My last request is <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Say you'll remember me <br />
Standing in a nice dress <br />
Staring at the sunset, babe <br />
Red lips and rosy cheeks <br />
Say you'll see me again <br />
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ha-ah, ha) <br />
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha <br />
</p>
<p className="bridge">
You'll see me in hindsight <br />
Tangled up with you all night <br />
Burning it down <br />
Someday when you leave me <br />
I bet these memories <br />
Follow you around <br />
You'll see me in hindsight <br />
Tangled up with you all night <br />
Burning (burning) it (it) down (down) <br />
Someday when you leave me <br />
I bet these memories <br />
Follow (follow) you (you) around (follow you around) <br />
</p>
<p className="breakdown">
Say you'll remember me <br />
Standing in a nice dress <br />
Staring at the sunset, babe <br />
Red lips and rosy cheeks <br />
Say you'll see me again <br />
Even if it's just pretend <br />
</p>
<p className="chorus">
Say you'll remember me <br />
Standing in a nice dress <br />
Staring at the sunset, babe <br />
Red lips and rosy cheeks <br />
Say you'll see me again <br />
Even if it's just (pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ah) <br />
In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha <br />
Even if it's just stayed in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha <br />
In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha <br />

## Quotes from artist
<blockquote>
I think the way I used to approach relationships was very idealistic. I used to go into them thinking, ‘Maybe this is the one – we’ll get married and have a family, this could be forever’. Whereas now I go in thinking, ‘How long do we have on the clock – before something comes along and puts a wrench in it, or your publicist calls and says this isn’t a good idea?’
- Taylor Swift
